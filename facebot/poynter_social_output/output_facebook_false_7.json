flowers kept blooming\nAnd the sun is shining\nAnd the swallows came back\nAnd the sky was colored pink and blue\nThe morning was kneading bread and baking the donuts\nIt was getting dark later and later and in the morning the lights came in early through the windows closed\nIt was March 11th 2020 the kids were studying connected to discord\nAnd in the afternoon the tressette meeting will be unfailing\nIt was the year you could go out just to get groceries\nAfter a little while they closed everything\nEven the offices\nThe army was starting to watch exits and boundaries\nBecause there was no more room for everyone in the hospitals\nAnd people got sick\nBut spring didn't know and the gems kept coming out\nIt was March 11  2020 everyone was placed in mandatory quarantine\nGrandparents families and young people\nSo the fear became real\nAnd the days all looked the same\nBut spring didn't know and roses came back to bloom\nThe pleasure of eating together again\nOf writing leaving imagination free\nOf reading flying with fantasy\nThere were those who learned a new language\nWho studied and who resumed the last exam that was missing from the thesis\nWho understood to love really separated from\nlife life\nWho stopped coming to terms with ignorance\nWho closed the office and opened a tavern with only eight covered\nWho left their girlfriend to scream love for their best friend to the world\nThere were those who became a doctor to help anyone who needed it tomorrow\nIt was the year you understood the importance of real health and affection\nThe year the world seemed to stop\nAnd the economy is going down\nBut spring didn't know it and flowers gave way to fruit\nAnd then came liberation day\nWe were on tv and the Prime Minister told unified networks that the emergency was over\nAnd that the virus had lost\nThat the Italians all together had won\nAnd then we went out on the street\nWith tears in my eyes\nWithout masks and gloves\nHugging our neighbor\nLike he was our brother\nAnd that's when summer came\nBecause spring didn't know\nAnd he kept on being there\nIn spite of everything\nDespite the virus\nIn spite of the fear\nIn spite of death\nBecause spring didn't know\nAnd he taught everyone\nThe strength of life.\nIrene Vella", "comments": "0", "shares": "7465", "reactions": {"all": 7500, "likes": 51000, "love": 23000, "wow": "49", "haha": "1",

he's gone  but not as scary as he's drawn.\nYes  the virus is  but it's no worse than the flu it was in 2009\nWhat's going on? How do you know people can be programmed  under those or other events. Tell how everything should be. Initially  the coronavirus  which is not scary  but then pneumonia  which is also atypical and not treated. If you predict everything to a person  then everything will be so. Nav\u00ed yuvan\u00ed  placebo... Information weapon... Plus fear will help these events happen. For example  in acupuncture  for any treatment  you need to remove the emotions of fear first. It is in fear that the root of any disease. And not only diseases  but any problems of life. The media has done their thing. Next  forced to walk in masks. Although it is commonly known that they should be worn only by the sick. On the roads put posts like those posts will help to keep the virus. A separate fear is fear of hunger and cold. Most are left without work and the opportunity to feed themselves and their family. And so on. I won't continue. A separate topic of sitting at home  that is  do not move and breathe fresh air. Even this will be enough to get lung inflammation. An example is in one of my previous posts. Many people haven't done anything from physical exercises before and didn't go out specifically outdoors. But at least moved to work and from work. It's actually catastrophic for athletes  as their body is more likely to function through muscle work. This will give an additional push to develop any diseases. Recall at least Dr. Komarovsky's lessons  who said that the cough does not increase in inflammation needs inhalation or even better fresh air. And all of us are quarantined. Coronavirus tests are exactly this mutated type. This is a separate conversation too. No matter how the Chinese invented it  no one would find this separate type of virus. You won't be found on anything in the next time?! Medicine and vaccine. They cannot be from a disease that does not exist. Another question  what is this panic being pushed for? Each country finds its moments. There is not little about this in my previous posts. An economic war. Everyone read about China  what exactly will it achieve internationally. China has achieved a lot inside the country. In China  it was actually planned \u2032\u2032 ACTION \u2032\u2032. Imagine  within a day to collect a hospital for several thousand men and not alone. Other countries saw the benefit and grabbed. Some have succumbed to panic  and some have officially no CORONAVIRUS. Italy first of all  will get rid of pensioners  although I really hope that this was not their goal. You do understand that it is pensioners who are most subjected to nav\u00ed yuvan\u00ed. Ukraine has introduced a law on land. I'm for him  but I don't think it's done like this during a pandemic and at night.\nBut the main thing here is that there has been a world crisis on the nose for a long time. And this virus will simultaneously be her catalyst and justification for the political elites of all countries of the cause of this crisis to continue to remain in their positions... Many have told me that I panic  but I constantly tried to scatter it  tried to make you wonder where it could all take you. Part of those critically thinking agreed with me  the other part panicked me and accused me of all earthly sins. Thank you both camps for  it was you who all helped me create this picture I submitted to you now. Once again  your right to believe or criticize. But remember yourself in the short 2009 Analyze how you then felt about the chicken or swine flu epidemic and how you are about that situation. Didn't it get funny?! But there is also a positive virus. This is probably the Lord's plan. People need to start relying more on themselves  not on business medicine. Must believe in God and start praying. Nature should take a little rest from human actions  which allows man not to die from his own actions. I want to emphasize that I do not urge you not to observe quarantine or walk without masks. As they say the guardian and God will save. Those who believe in it are obligatory to wear it and it will really help you. I trust in God  nature wisdom  healthy lifestyle  sport  exercise  nutrition  psychosomatics  healthy sleep  positive mood... That's why I follow life. And that's exactly what will help me. I also wear a mask in crowded places  but in order for people not to fear me and of course to follow the general state rules. I think this post will have a lot of reposts  so I will write about myself: father of three children  doctor of pedagogical sciences (thesis is in the field of human health  not modern pharmaceutical business). I have several higher education - technical  legal  pedagogical  psychologist and coach. Master of sports  well-deserved coach of Ukraine  founder of the network of sports clubs and shops  repeated medalist of the World Cups in wrestling sambo and judo  public and political figure.
