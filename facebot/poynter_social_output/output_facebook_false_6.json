Instead  it is spreading in a country like Switzerland  in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. Whereas if it were natural  it would have spread in cold places  but died in hot places. I have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses. It is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all  after the Coronavirus surfaced. But all their phones are dead for the last 3 months. It is now understood that all these lab technicians have died. Based on all my knowledge and research till date  I can say this with 100% confidence - That the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it. If what I am saying today is proved false now or even after my death  the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize. China is lying and this truth will one day be revealed to everyone\".", "comments": "0", "shares": "221", "reactions": {"all": " 143", "likes": "90", "love": "1", "wow": "35", "haha": 0, "sad": "13",

Health Secretary Francisco Duque: Secretary Duque  as IATF head and Health chief  plays a crucial role in addressing the public health crisis. He could have made a significant difference to the current COVID-19 situation in the country if not for his denial of the pandemic's gravity  and lack of foresight and preparedness. The administration has missed one opportunity after another to prevent and contain the spread of the disease early on. Enhanced community quarantine can do very little without the necessary mass testing  and provision of expedient government support. As much as Sec. Duque is accountable for all these  he cannot be scapegoated for the overall delays and mispriorities in the COVID-19 response. Thus  Kabataan Partylist supports the Senate Resolution calling for Sec. Duque's resignation. The youth party-list would like to stress  however  that it should not be just Sec. Duque  but the Duterte regime  at the helm of COVID-19 response and with the President delegated with emergency powers  must be held all the more accountable. Three weeks since the grant of emergency powers to the President  less than half  or only 5-million out of the 18-M supposed beneficiaries  have received aid from the Social Amelioration Program. Delayed distribution of livelihood and economic relief for the most vulnerable has endangered the poor with hunger and destitution more than the coronavirus. Even health workers  risking everything in the front lines  are not exempt from this administration\u2019s criminal negligence with insufficient to no timely provision of PPEs. These blunders should never be taken lightly because of fatal consequences. According to latest reports  at least 21 health workers and medical professionals have died combatting COVID-19 due to exposure to the virus and lack of protective gear. The one-month period for the enhanced community quarantine has already passed. Yet  even with its extension  the government\u2019s lack of a comprehensive plan to address the health crisis and combat the COVID-19 remains glaring. The report of Deep Knowledge Venture  a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm that focuses on health care and longevity technology  that the Philippines is the least safe country in the Asia Pacific amid the COVID-19 pandemic  reflects this. Its evaluation is based on these parameters: the lowest likelihood of infection  the lowest chance of mortality  and the highest likelihood of recovery based on the efficiency of quarantine and government management  monitoring and detection  and emergency treatment readiness. This should serve not only as a wake-up call  but a push for holding the government accountable for negligence to the plight of millions of marginalized and vulnerable Filipinos. We must unite to intensify our health and socio-economic demands  and push the government to systematize and prioritize response to COVID-19 crisis.###", "comments": "0", "shares": "33", "reactions":

Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook  I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all  I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark  he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well  you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases  people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally  you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah  you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark  they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now  the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease  if they had mild symptoms  we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes  they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1 765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact  you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH  that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble  your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home  don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case  they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES  ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally  people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30  he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people  their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34  he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES  but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes  they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda  USC  UCLA  Stanford  U of Washington  etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes  but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately  this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes  they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes  they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat  the clothes you wear  the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them.

"2912960798825334", "author": "Somanadhan Ayikkara", "facebook_date": "April 21  2020 at 4:22 AM", "content": "Webinar by IMF  chaired by Raguram Rajan  this morning. Key takeaways are as follows.\n*General Outlook*\n1. India seems to have supressed the curve so far. It looks like it might escape the worst of the pandemic  but will have to be cautious about it.\n2. Possibility of W Curve \u2013 i.e. There is a good chance of re-occurrence of the virus  which could see a possibility of regular lockdowns. Businesses need to plan accordingly.\n3. Capital will look for countries that are less battered. Western economies are badly battered while countries like India  Indonesia  etc are not so battered. Global Capital could flow into India  if we can act efficiently to pull it.\n4. Emotional and Economic backlash against China is expected. Already  countries and companies are working on strategy to pivot away from China as part of their supply chains. Japan Govt has announced packages for it\u2019s companies bringing back manufacturing home. Businesses need to keep this in mind and work accordingly. *Discretionary Spending.*\n1. For individuals  health and safety will become No.1 on their agenda from the 3rd of 4th place. There will be more spending on this area and reduction in other discretionary spends.\n2. The ticket size of spending will drop for a while. People will spend on cheaper goods than on expensive goods  or delay spending for a while.\n3. Extreme acceleration in digital economy. I.e. Home education  home entertainment  home fitness  etc\n4. Loyalty shock. People will be less loyal towards brands as other aspects will take over. People will switch brands faster due to various other concerns like safety  etc.\n5. General Trust deficit. There will be trust deficit amongst stakeholders like vendors  customers  employees  borrowers  banks  etc. Banks will have trust deficit with borrowers  companies will have trust deficit with suppliers  etc. *Liquidity and P&L*\n1. Segregate Good Costs and Bad Costs\na. Good costs (Eg. Digitization  tech costs  digital marketing  best employees  etc) need to be insulated and protected\nb. Bad Costs (Eg. Fancy office  unnecessary spending  bad performers  traditional working methods) need to be ruthlessly eliminated. Don\u2019t be emotional about non-core businesses. Concentrate on core business.\n2. Be Frugal \u2013 Not necessary to have fancy office  fancy cars  excess employee strength  etc. Remove all the flab and be lean.\n3. Maintain Good behaviour \u2013 have frank and open conversation with all stakeholders like suppliers  employees  etc and try to find the middle ground  so that the burden can be shared justly.\n4. Be Future Ready \u2013 In this crisis  there will be winners and there will be losers. Those who re-orient their strategy will be winners. *Govt Stimulus.*\n1. Economy was in poor shape even before Covid. The govt has little leeway to provide large stimulus.\n2. Govt earns about $60-70 billion a week from taxes. Imagine what a hit a 5-week lockdown will have. Size of Indian economy is about $3 Trillion. In some scenarios  it is predicted that Govt could take a hit of nearly $1 Trillion.\n3. Inequality has already sharpened. The gap between rich and poor has further increased. Govt needs to concentrate on mass health and mass welfare. If not  200 million people could sink into poverty.\n4. Govt must explore printing currency (Quantitative easing)  but there are limitations here. It has side effects like inflation  etc. Rich countries have more leeway for such quantitative easing.\n5. Govt must concentrate on grabbing more capital from outside and do reforms to enable that. *Result of backlash against China*\n1. Internationally  there could be an emotional and economic backlash against China.\n2. Businesses with supply chains passing through China will need to keep this in mind and insulate themselves and build alternatives.\n3. India and Indian businesses need to try to become the contract manufacturer of the world  just like China is. India needs to make use of this opportunity smartly.\n4. All big wealth funds and soverign funds will be awash with Liquidity. This liquidity needs to be attracted to India.\n5. In every sector  there are good and bad companies. Management has to invest correctly in manufacturing and modern tech  be honest and fair to all stakeholders  etc.  Those companies with good management and displaying good behaviour will come out victorious. *Export Business*\n1. Indian exporters need to build trust. They need live up to promises made. They need to deliver on time and deliver the promised quality. They shouldn\u2019t make incorrect promises just to get more business.\n2. Bangladesh export business has built trust and a good reputation. Despite a chequered past (low quality  human rights issues  etc) they have managed to overcome and are winning. *Wholesale  Retail  etc.*\n1. More people will prefer to buy from retail stores where there is perception of safety (Eg. Sanitation  cleanliness  crowds  etc). They will move more towards malls away from markets. Many will move towards online stores. Wholesale suppliers also need to concentrate on such retailers.\n2. Customers also need to be ringfenced:\na. A high end restaurant in Delhi is giving 40% of bill value as a gift coupon to be used anytime upto December 2020.\nb. Car companies are giving buy back offers  incase the customer loses his job in the next one year.\n3. Pricing needs to be re-approached. People are looking for cheaper prices or cheaper goods. *Brick & Mortar in Discretionary Spends.*\n1. Cinemas could take a big hit in the near future. Entertainment could move home.\n2. Because of this  cafes and restaurants might see some increase in business. Many chains are implementing measures like social distancing like lesser furniture  etc  to build confidence to consumers.\n3. Smaller retailers need to send a message of safety. Eg: Have sanitisers  put up notice of no Covid positive employee found in the store  maintain social distancing  etc.\n4. Since travel and tourism will take a big hit  connected purchases will also shift. Purchases that happened abroad will happen at home. (Eg. Electronics  Luxury goods and apparel  etc. ). But travel related purchases will drop. *Real Estate*\n1. Indian real estate economy is sitting on a huge inventory with a huge cost-of-carry\n2. The industry is highly leveraged with low margins.\n3. Unsold inventory is considered as an appreciating asset  but might turn out to be a flawed view.\n4. Market was already overdue for a huge reset  which will be accelerated by the pandemic.\n5. Also  the sharing and co-working space could be hit as more businesses try to have their own smaller spaces and more WFH employees. *Jewellery etc.*\n1. Gold-as-an-asset could see appreciation.\n2. Jewelry  as a discretionary spend  will take a hit.\n3. The Indian wedding industry will take a hit  as social distancing  cost consciousness  travel avoidance  etc.  will prevent fat weddings  destination weddings  etc. This will hit all connected industries. (Eg. Silk  partywear  etc) *Financial Markets*\n1. There will be value destruction and value creation in different companies in the same sector.\n2. High Debt low margin companies will find it difficult. (indicates risky or unscrouplus management)\n3. High Debt high margin companies could be rewarded  but caution needs to be exercised. (may indicate sharp or dynamic management)\n4. No debt high margin companies are best rewarded now.\n5. Know more about the CEO and management and their actions and activities.\n(Eg: 3 branches of Starbucks were kept open in India for last few days. The CEO of Starbucks India sat in the Fort (Mumbai) branch throughout the day to give his employees confidence and motivation)\n6. New tech unicorns will be born. Those involved in cyber security  cloud services  online education services  etc. *Forex Markets*\n1. No doomsday scenario (i.e. Dollar will become 90 rupees etc). Such scenarios don\u2019t seem realistic\n2. Govt should be buying as much oil as possible  as such prices may never be seen in the future of oil.\n3. As the western economies are more battered and Indian economy is less battered so far  there is more liquidity coming in. That\u2019s why there is a rally in the market. This scenario could change depending on the spread of the disease in India.\n4. Watch out for sharp spikes in the market. Better to avoid the spikes. *Outlook for near future.*\n*A. Large Companies*\na. Huge concern seen for employees. Companies are paying the employees even when closed.\nb. HUL Decided not to cut a single rupee for their suppliers  service providers  etc. No haircuts.\nc. Safety of employees and customers is becoming a major point of focus.\nd. This is possible because they have reserves of funds  etc that have been built up over the years. *B. Medium and Small businesses.*\na. They have to work with thin capital reserves. Excess capital is taken out of the business and applied into personal assets.\nb. Small businesses take out the surplus and purchase personal assets instead of re-investing in the business. There are various factors and motivations here.\nc. Because of this  they are unable to meet the cash expenses of even the next month.\nd. A high end restaurant chain in Delhi (with Rs.40 crore annual turnover) is unable to pay the salaries of the current month as it has no liquid reserve. Owner has invested in personal assets like house in London  etc.\ne. Medium and Small business need to have a look at how they can build some business reserves to endure such disruptions. *\u201cForce Majeure\u201d in Contracts*\n1. Should force majeure clauses be triggerd in various contracts like rent  supply  etc? It will lead to litigation  but there is no point in getting into litigation now.\n2. All parties have been affected by the crisis. The tenants  the landlords  the lenders/financiers  etc.\n3. Parties need to sit across the table and find a common ground and mutually decide upon the costs  rentals  etc. Burden has to be shared. *Work From Home Scenario.*\n1. It is possible for lot of employees to not visit the office and still be productive.\n2. In RBL corporate office  it is found that it is enough that only 30% staff stay in the office. Others can be connected from homes. This leads to lesser commute expense  stress of the commute  time wasted  etc. \n3. Parents can take care of children more effectively when WFH. There can be dark hours when no calls will be made  etc.  *Optimism*\nAs per a McKinsey survey of entrepreneurs released few days ago  53% of Indian entrepreneurs are optimistic  while only 25% of Japanese entrepreneurs are optimistic.\nIt seems to be a mild U-Curve for the Indian economy. But the descent has not stopped yet.", "comments": "1", "shares": "3", "reactions": {"all": "3", "likes": "3", "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": 4996, "checked_link": "https://factly.in/raghuram-rajan-has-clarified-that-he-did-not-participate-in-any-such-imf-webinar-session/", "countries": "India", "date": "2020-04-21", "justify": "explanation raghuram rajan has clarified that he has not participated in any such webinar session by imf and the message circulating on social media is fake also  on the imf website  there is no mention of such webinar session chaired by rajan", "label": "FALSE", "source": " Factly", "title": " list of key takeaways on how india has successfully handled the covid19 crisis from an imf webinar session chaired by raghuram rajan", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=list-of-key-takeaways-on-how-india-has-successfully-handled-the-covid-19-crisis-from-an-imf-webinar-session-chaired-by-raghuram-rajan", "facebook_id": "2912960798825334", "author": "Somanadhan Ayikkara", "facebook_date": "April 21  2020 at 4:22 AM", "content": "Webinar by IMF  chaired by Raguram Rajan  this morning.

India and Indian businesses need to try to become the contract manufacturer of the world  just like China is. India needs to make use of this opportunity smartly.\n4. All big wealth funds and soverign funds will be awash with Liquidity. This liquidity needs to be attracted to India.\n5. In every sector  there are good and bad companies. Management has to invest correctly in manufacturing and modern tech  be honest and fair to all stakeholders  etc.  Those companies with good management and displaying good behaviour will come out victorious. *Export Business*\n1. Indian exporters need to build trust. They need live up to promises made. They need to deliver on time and deliver the promised quality. They shouldn\u2019t make incorrect promises just to get more business.\n2. Bangladesh export business has built trust and a good reputation. Despite a chequered past (low quality  human rights issues  etc) they have managed to overcome and are winning. *Wholesale  Retail  etc.*\n1. More people will prefer to buy from retail stores where there is perception of safety (Eg. Sanitation  cleanliness  crowds  etc). They will move more towards malls away from markets. Many will move towards online stores. Wholesale suppliers also need to concentrate on such retailers.\n2. Customers also need to be ringfenced:\na. A high end restaurant in Delhi is giving 40% of bill value as a gift coupon to be used anytime upto December 2020.\nb. Car companies are giving buy back offers  incase the customer loses his job in the next one year.\n3. Pricing needs to be re-approached. People are looking for cheaper prices or cheaper goods. *Brick & Mortar in Discretionary Spends.*\n1. Cinemas could take a big hit in the near future. Entertainment could move home.\n2. Because of this  cafes and restaurants might see some increase in business. Many chains are implementing measures like social distancing like lesser furniture  etc  to build confidence to consumers.\n3. Smaller retailers need to send a message of safety. Eg: Have sanitisers  put up notice of no Covid positive employee found in the store  maintain social distancing  etc.\n4. Since travel and tourism will take a big hit  connected purchases will also shift. Purchases that happened abroad will happen at home. (Eg. Electronics  Luxury goods and apparel  etc. ). But travel related purchases will drop. *Real Estate*\n1. Indian real estate economy is sitting on a huge inventory with a huge cost-of-carry\n2. The industry is highly leveraged with low margins.\n3. Unsold inventory is considered as an appreciating asset  but might turn out to be a flawed view.\n4. Market was already overdue for a huge reset  which will be accelerated by the pandemic.\n5. Also  the sharing and co-working space could be hit as more businesses try to have their own smaller spaces and more WFH employees. *Jewellery etc.*\n1. Gold-as-an-asset could see appreciation.\n2. Jewelry  as a discretionary spend  will take a hit.\n3. The Indian wedding industry will take a hit  as social distancing  cost consciousness  travel avoidance  etc.  will prevent fat weddings  destination weddings  etc. This will hit all connected industries. (Eg. Silk  partywear  etc) *Financial Markets*\n1. There will be value destruction and value creation in different companies in the same sector.\n2. High Debt low margin companies will find it difficult. (indicates risky or unscrouplus management)\n3. High Debt high margin companies could be rewarded  but caution needs to be exercised. (may indicate sharp or dynamic management)\n4. No debt high margin companies are best rewarded now.\n5. Know more about the CEO and management and their actions and activities.\n(Eg: 3 branches of Starbucks were kept open in India for last few days. The CEO of Starbucks India sat in the Fort (Mumbai) branch throughout the day to give his employees confidence and motivation)\n6. New tech unicorns will be born. Those involved in cyber security  cloud services  online education services  etc. *Forex Markets*\n1. No doomsday scenario (i.e. Dollar will become 90 rupees etc). Such scenarios don\u2019t seem realistic\n2. Govt should be buying as much oil as possible  as such prices may never be seen in the future of oil.\n3. As the western economies are more battered and Indian economy is less battered so far  there is more liquidity coming in. That\u2019s why there is a rally in the market. This scenario could change depending on the spread of the disease in India.\n4. Watch out for sharp spikes in the market. Better to avoid the spikes. *Outlook for near future.*\n*A. Large Companies*\na. Huge concern seen for employees. Companies are paying the employees even when closed.\nb. HUL Decided not to cut a single rupee for their suppliers  service providers  etc. No haircuts.\nc. Safety of employees and customers is becoming a major point of focus.\nd. This is possible because they have reserves of funds  etc that have been built up over the years. *B. Medium and Small businesses.*\na. They have to work with thin capital reserves. Excess capital is taken out of the business and applied into personal assets.\nb. Small businesses take out the surplus and purchase personal assets instead of re-investing in the business. There are various factors and motivations here.\nc. Because of this  they are unable to meet the cash expenses of even the next month.\nd. A high end restaurant chain in Delhi (with Rs.40 crore annual turnover) is unable to pay the salaries of the current month as it has no liquid reserve. Owner has invested in personal assets like house in London  etc.\ne. Medium and Small business need to have a look at how they can build some business reserves to endure such disruptions. *\u201cForce Majeure\u201d in Contracts*\n1. Should force majeure clauses be triggerd in various contracts like rent  supply  etc? It will lead to litigation  but there is no point in getting into litigation now.\n2. All parties have been affected by the crisis. The tenants  the landlords  the lenders/financiers  etc.\n3. Parties need to sit across the table and find a common ground and mutually decide upon the costs  rentals  etc. Burden has to be shared. *Work From Home Scenario.*\n1. It is possible for lot of employees to not visit the office and still be productive.\n2. In RBL corporate office  it is found that it is enough that only 30% staff stay in the office. Others can be connected from homes. This leads to lesser commute expense  stress of the commute  time wasted  etc. \n3. Parents can take care of children more effectively when WFH. There can be dark hours when no calls will be made  etc.  *Optimism*\nAs per a McKinsey survey of entrepreneurs released few days ago  53% of Indian entrepreneurs are optimistic  while only 25% of Japanese entrepreneurs are optimistic.\nIt seems to be a mild U-Curve for the Indian economy. But the descent has not stopped yet.", "comments": "1", "shares": "3", "reactions": {"all": "3", "likes": "3", "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true,

Oh  and did anyone notice that while they are mad as hell at Trump for not sending aid to Ukraine  they THEMSELVES voted AGAINST giving ANY emergency aid to all Americans ?\nSorry but I don't think we are all going to die. Remember when Ebola was what was going to kill us all  and the media kept showing the piles of body bags that were prepared for the fallout. Then a month later it was totally forgotten.\nThe common flu has killed more people this year already and the media is SILENT!\nA handful of deaths out of 320 million Americans and we are in panic tearing down our society and costing our economy billions in the wake. It all just seems fishy  a little too well-timed if you ask me.\nPlease copy and share.", "comments": "231", "shares": "1068", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0,

Don't be offended by priests that they are afraid. IT'S you fault because they're alone. Jesus Christ before his passions asked the disciples not to sleep  but to pray. Three times He came to them but they slept. Wake up I'm telling you! We will not allow the sanctuary to despise and desecrate it.

Ang lockdown  ECQ ay dapat nakatuon sa virus.

Ovo je bila jo\u0161 jedna takva situacija.\n\nVidio sam ju\u010der ilustraciju  navodno iz 1889.  na kojoj se vidi u\u017eas elektrifikacije. Ma vidjeli ste je sigurno. Ona neka bandera s milijun \u017eica  na njoj preizrasla \u017earulja  a oko toga nekoliko mrtvih ljudi i jedan konj. Isto mrtav. Netko ju je podijelio da poka\u017ee kako se eto oko svake nove tehnologije javljaju ljudi koji pla\u0161e druge. I sad je tako oko ove 5G. Iskreno  meni se to ba\u0161 i nije svidjelo. To \u0161to je ne\u0161to novo  ne zna\u010di automatski da je i dobro. A ova argumentacija je to sugerirala.\n\nIspalo je tako da sam prekju\u010der bio podletio pod neki komentar o tome da je je frekvencija mikrovalova u 5G mre\u017ei ve\u0107a od onih u 4G pa je zato ona i opasnija. Reko - za\u0161to to\u010dno? Ka\u017ee \u010dovjek - jer znamo da je zra\u010denje vi\u0161e energije opasnije. Rendgensko je opasnije od radiovalova. Ma je  ka\u017eem mu ja  ali kako frekvencija raste od mikrovalova dalje  prvo do\u0111emo do toplinskih valova iz na\u0161ih radijatora  a onda do svjetlosti iz na\u0161ih \u017earulja. Nismo jo\u0161 do\u0161li ni do UV zraka  a gdje su tek ove za slikanje zuba. I plu\u0107a. Ta logika da je ve\u0107a frekvencija automatski opasnija jednostavno ne stoji.\n\nI tako ja danas jo\u0161 pod dojmom te rasprave podijelim onu sliku sa \u017earuljom na banderi. I napi\u0161em da su ovako pla\u0161ili ljude da \u0107e ih uli\u010dna rasvjeta sve pobiti. I da su imali su pravo  jer da su to jo\u0161 ve\u0107e frekvencije od 5G.\n\nA onda je krenuo kaos.\n\nPrvo se javio lik koji je zaklju\u010dio da je tu\u017eno \u0161to komentiram stvari o kojima nemam pojma. Pa me podu\u010dio kako je 2001. bila Pti\u010dja gripa i 3G  2009. Svinjska gripa i 4G  a eto sad 2020. s Coronom i 5G. Slu\u010dajnost  pita on. S dva upitnika.\n\nI ja mu dam graf broja doktorata iz sociologije u SAD-u i graf nekomercijalnih svemirskih letova. Tko nije vidio  oblikom su prakti\u010dno isti. I napisao mu da ako se pita kakve to ima veze jedno s drugime  da se pita upravo ono pitanje koje se ja pitam kad gledam te njegove podatke. To \u0161to se par stvari poklopilo jo\u0161 uvijek ne zna\u010di da su one u vezi (a i pitanje je koliko su se uop\u0107e poklopile  ako malo pro\u010da\u010dkamo geografski i kronolo\u0161ki te stvari).\n\nNije pomoglo.\n\nA onda je naletio i drugi. Prvo me podu\u010dio da je i Korado Korlevi\u0107 imao neke primjedbe na javnu rasvjetu. Nakon te FB \u0161kole  nastavio je pitanjem postoji li koja studija koja prou\u010dava ljudsko toroidalno polje i utjecaj 5G frekvencija na isto? Ljudsko toroidalno polje?! Isusedragibo\u017ee. Ovo zadnje je bio jedini komentar koji je uspio iscuriti ispod mojih prstiju.\n\nIspalo je da se njime na\u0161ao iznena\u0111en. I uvrije\u0111en. Pa odgovara da je to izvrstan odgovor jednog istra\u017eitelja znanstvenika. I da zato i jesmo tu gdje jesmo.\n\nZato smo tu gdje jesmo?! Zbog mene?!\n\nGle  te\u0161ko da je zbog nebitnog mene. Ali mo\u017eda jesmo zbog drugih znanstvenika? Aj ba\u0161 da vidimo.\n\nZnanstvenici su 2007. predvidjeli da \u0107e neki od korona virusa iz \u0161i\u0161mi\u0161a prije\u0107i na \u010dovjeka. Da je to tempirana bomba zbog prehrambenih navika u Kini. Nitko ih nije \u0161ljivio pet posto. Koga briga za nekakve \u0161i\u0161mi\u0161e u Kini. Ali tarot  to je ne\u0161to za znanstveni program na televiziji. To stvarno predvi\u0111a budu\u0107nost.\n\nZnanstvenici su 2016. prona\u0161li potencijalno cjepivo za korona virus vrlo sli\u010dan ovome na\u0161em. Ukinuli su im financiranje za daljnje istra\u017eivanje pa nikad nije dovr\u0161eno. Jer koga zanima cjepivo protiv nekakve bezvezne obi\u010dne prehlade. Nije to u\u010dinkovito ulo\u017een novac. Ali solarna joga  to je zakon \u2013 ljudi gledaju u sunce i ne moraju jesti. Toga nam daj vi\u0161e. Toga i one homeopatije. A cjepiva su ionako opasna. To svi znamo. Bilo je na televiziji.\n\nZnanstvenici i medicinski stru\u010dnjaci 2020. uspje\u0161no se nose s epidemijama u svim zemljama u kojima im politika to dozvoljava. Epidemijama izazvanim glupo\u0161\u0107u ljudi koji nisu slu\u0161ali znanstvenike kad su ih upozoravali na opasnost. I svi sad mo\u017eemo \u017ealiti \u0161to nemamo barem napola gotov alat za prevenciju  poput onog cjepiva.\n\nAli zato \u0107e nam ovdje na fejsu jedan obja\u0161njavati da je uzrok epidemije u 5G mre\u017ei  izvla\u010de\u0107i argumente (\u010duj  argumente) iz prsta. A ovaj drugi propituje mogu\u0107i utjecaj 5G na ljudsko toroidalno polje.\n\nZa one koji su izdr\u017eali do ovog mjesta ne guglaju\u0107i \u0161to je ljudsko toroidalno polje  evo vam odgovora. Mislim da prijevod ne treba (ali dodat \u0107u ga kasnije jer je divno).\n\n\"From the inside  your heart emanates an extremely powerful toroidal energetic field  and it has actually been scientifically measured to go out as far as 5 miles from your heart.\"\n\n\"The heart\u2019s electromagnetic frequency arcs out from the heart and back in the form of a torus field  which is the oldest structure in existence.\"\n\n\"Toroidal energy fields exist around everything: people  trees  the earth  sun  and Universe.\"\n\n\"Have you ever met someone and just thought  \u201cWow they have such a nice aura about them.\u201d Well  the human aura\u2019s shape is that of a torus.\"\n\nI  naravno  sve je to znanost.\n\n\"The torus is the first scientific model that shows that we are distinct individuals  yet we are all interconnected.\"\n\nI onda sam ja onaj zbog kojeg smo tu gdje jesmo. Ili drugi znanstvenici. Ne  majstore. Ti si taj zbog kojeg smo sada ovdje. A ja te uop\u0107e ne napadam zbog toga. Nisam ljut na tebe. Ni na ikoga.\n\nZnam da nam u ovakvim vremenima treba malo sigurnosti. Malo osje\u0107aja da imamo kontrolu. Ova situacija nas uporno podsje\u0107a koliko malo stvari mi zaista znamo i imamo pod kontrolom. I zato nam trebaju krvici - zlo\u010desti ljudi koji postavljaju 5G mre\u017eu i izazivaju epidemije. I te lude teorije zavjera. \u010cipiraju nas cijepljenjem. Ili truju. Ili rade ne\u0161to jo\u0161 gore  jer ni ne znamo \u0161to  pa je to neko jo\u0161e ve\u0107e i stra\u0161nije zlo.\n\nRezultat je da se po nekim anketama cirka pola ljudi ne bi ni cijepilo od korone \u010dak i da postoji cjepivo. Razumijem to. I ne ljuti me. Samo mi je \u017eao da ni\u0161ta od onog \u0161to smo poku\u0161ali objasniti toliko puta dosad nije pomoglo.\n\nJako mi je \u017eao.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic \u2013

In the very least  the Democrats have certainly used it politically. Can't trust them  or Communist totalitarians. Written by Bill O'Reilly China\u2019s Bio weapon  and Pelosi.. My wife Angie will tell you that I study history and world events fluently every day. I have studied China for many years. To get answers I need to questions  I call many I know in Washington on Capitol Hill (from my tenure on two Presidential campaigns and Presidential talks) and I ask them for straight up answers to better understand what affects us as a nation. Well  in 2016 America elected a new Sheriff: Donald J Trump. For decades the Chinese walked all over America but the new President said \u201cnot anymore\u201d. Trump literally strangled China\u2019s economy to the point their economy was in its worst free fall ever. Trump negotiated a new 50 billion trade agreement. He had Xi by the proverbial balls. America\u2019s economy was on fire and unstoppable. President Xi Jingping knew he could not beat the USA militarily and he knew any domesticated economic attack would fail as our economy was too strong. He had to act. But how? Enter the USA democrats led by Pelosi and Schiff. Impeachment. A hoax. A distraction for our people and President. Xi Jingping and his thugs see this. They aren\u2019t stupid. They have very intelligent intellectual thinkers in their government. Now you must understand   the Chinese regime are truly Barbarians. Notice I did not say ALL CHINESE. The Chinese people are a good people. I enjoy my interactions with them. The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy  like a deceptive fox. In my opinion  I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone  but kills \u201cenough \u201d especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society. Trumps task force uses models to figure things. Xi used and uses \u201cmodels\u201d too. China's president figured that if he killed a few of his own (a few hundred thousand to them would be a few out of 1.4 billion people) and spread the virus to other nations (especially to the USA) they would \u201clevel the economic playing field\u201d and not have fired a shot. Losses of his own people were acceptable costs of a new war. When China\u2019s own doctors attempted to sound the warning  they were immediately silenced. In fact one died and another has simply disappeared. Trump and the other allied leaders indeed KNOW this is what happened. They have under reported their own deaths. Trump knows he cannot outrightly seek retribution. His news conference today showed me this when he balked publicly about no outright retribution over Xi\u2019s handling of this and he immediately brought up the \u201ctrade deal\u201d. However  Trump wasn\u2019t being weak  he too was now being coy. We know this was a biological weapon. The food market story is bullshit. Xi knows we know it. Trump also today announced he sent two battle groups of destroyers and other ships to sea several days ago to fight drugs and rogue actors like Iran should they try anything. I say he did this to show Xi he knows what has transpired (we have the greatest intelligence assets) and that they (the Chinese) should rethink further action. Politics is premier. We cannot overtly attack China for what they have done as we would also suffer greatly. We all know this. But China has temporarily achieved its goal. America was literally consumed by Trumps phony impeachment brought by the ultra left democrats (supported by democrat rank and file and one Republican Mitt Romney) and Xi Jingping saw an opening. He took it. Xi did what Trump usually does...he walked onto the world stage and threw a grenade into the \u201croom\u201d and left. It exploded in the form of this worldwide pandemic. It brought the USA and the rest of the world to its knees and leveled the economic playing field. Our economy is now near depression. Xi didn\u2019t fire one bullet. Trump needed to up his game of chess and putting our Naval ships to sea was his next move. He said he is a \u201cwar\u201d President. He is. But now on not one but two fronts. One front is the virus and the other front is the Chinese. While the Saudi\u2019s and Russians are screwing with oil prices they aren\u2019t overtly doing what this pandemic is doing. The drug smuggling story for dispatching the Naval Force is bullshit and the world knows it. I am of the opinion Trump can indeed bring us back from this catastrophe albeit with a changed playing field. But Trump is a genius in chess and financial matters. He\u2019s become a champ at international politics too. I am sure Trump can once again lead the economy to even stronger strength and greatness the it was . He can do it quickly I\u2019m sure of it. He has proved it. Xi Jingping needs to be sent a message loud and clear. NEVER AGAIN. We need to bring all of our critical manufacturing back from China beginning with our medicines they were recently threatening to withhold. We can do it immediately. Again  another reason for Trump putting to sea such a sizable Naval Force. Sending a clear message. We all must ride out the next few weeks. Then we and the world pick up the pieces and move on. The democrats who have given Xi this opening wrapped in a bow must pay a heavy price in November as they (the democrats) truly have cost and continue to cost America precious lives by the phony scandals. Nancy Pelosi continues to help the Chinese by her daily shameless attacks upon the President and meddling in stimulus packages as she did this last weekend. Yesterday\u2019s statements she made were truly appalling and the lowest of low. I didn\u2019t think she could go any lower. What a disgrace she is to our nation. But  Pelosi aside  make no mistake  China must and will be taught a lesson the likes they have never seen before and Trump is the man to pull the trigger. We the people must teach the democrats the same lesson at the polls. They (the radical wing of the party) are the enemy of a free America. I am certain of it. The entire democrat party of our forefathers is dead. Remember people  Trump indeed tried to warn us all of the Conavirus in his State of the Union Speech. He spoke of it. He said he was on top of it. After he spoke   Nancy Pelosi ripped up the speech calling Trumps words \u201ca manifesto of lies\u201d. She disgraced the country and all of our fellow honored citizens present in the House Chamber. Well she now has American blood on her hands. She is very majorly responsible for these needless deaths as well as the Chinese. Her and Adam Schiff. The left and democrats laughed as she tore up his speech. Well  as they laughed the disease he just spoke of in that speech came to our shores. Republicans and Democrats alike are now dying. Your family members and mine. Our grandparents and middle aged citizens alike. Bodies are being loaded in trucks with forklifts in Brooklyn outside of hospitals. No one is safe. Our liberty is for the most part suspended. As we bury our dead (without proper funerals) from this calamity let\u2019s drive the nails into the coffin of the Democrat party as well in November. It\u2019s time people. Stand up for your rights and your country! Our Liberty and survival is at stake! I am praying for God\u2019s blessing on our nation. But  God also gave us the ability to think for ourselves and it\u2019s time we placed blame for all this death where it belongs: on the doorsteps of Nancy Pelosi  Adam Schiff and Xi Jingping directly.

We cannot overtly attack China for what they have done as we would also suffer greatly. We all know this. But China has temporarily achieved its goal. America was literally consumed by Trumps phony impeachment brought by the ultra left democrats (supported by democrat rank and file and one Republican Mitt Romney) and Xi Jingping saw an opening. He took it. Xi did what Trump usually does...he walked onto the world stage and threw a grenade into the \u201croom\u201d and left. It exploded in the form of this worldwide pandemic. It brought the USA and the rest of the world to its knees and leveled the economic playing field. Our economy is now near depression. Xi didn\u2019t fire one bullet. Trump needed to up his game of chess and putting the our Naval ships to sea was his next move. He said he is a \u201cwar\u201d President. He is. But now on not one but two fronts. One front of the virus and the other front the Chinese. While the Saudi\u2019s and Russians are screwing with oil prices they aren\u2019t overtly doing what this pandemic is doing. The drug smuggling story for dispatching the Naval Force is bullshit and the world knows it. I am of the opinion Trump can indeed bring us back from this catastrophe albeit with a changed playing field. But Trump is a genius in chess and financial matters. He\u2019s become a champ at international politics too. I am sure Trump can once again lead the economy to even stronger strength and greatness the it was . He can do it quickly I\u2019m sure of it. He has proved it. Xi Jingping needs to be sent a message loud and clear. NEVER AGAIN. We need to bring all of our critical manufacturing back from a China beginning with our medicines they were recently threatening to withhold. We can do it immediately. Again  another reason for Trump putting to sea such a sizable Naval Force. Sending a clear message. We all must ride out the next few weeks. Then we and the world pick up the pieces and move on. The democrats who have given Xi this opening wrapped in a bow must pay a heavy price in November as they (the democrats) truly have cost and continue to cost America precious lives by the phony scandals. Nancy Pelosi continues to help the Chinese by her daily shameless attacks upon the President and meddling in stimulus packages as she did this last weekend. Yesterday\u2019s statements she made were truly appalling and lowest of low. I didn\u2019t think she could go any lower. What a disgrace she is to our nation. But  Pelosi aside  make no mistake  China must and will be taught a lesson the likes they have never seen before and Trump is the man to pull the trigger. We the people must teach the democrats the same lesson at the polls. They (the radical wing of the party). are the enemy of a free America. I am certain of it. The entire democrat party of our forefathers is dead. Remember people  Trump indeed tried to warn us all of the Conavirus in his State of the Union Speech. He spoke of it. He said he was on top of it. After he spoke   Nancy Pelosi ripped up the speech calling Trumps words \u201ca manifesto of lies\u201d. She disgraced the country and all of our fellow honored citizens present in the House Chamber. Well she now has American blood on her hands. She is very majorly responsible for these needless deaths as well as the Chinese. Her and Adam Schiff. The left and democrats laughed as she tore up his speech. Well  as they laughed the disease he just spoke of in that speech came to our shores. Republicans and Democrats alike are now dying. Your family members and mine. Our grandparents and middle aged citizens alike. Bodies are being loaded in trucks with forklifts in Brooklyn outside of hospitals. No one is safe. Our liberty is for the most part suspended. As we bury our dead (without proper funerals) from this calamity let\u2019s drive the nails into the coffin of the Democrat party as well in November. It\u2019s time people. Stand up for your rights and your country! Our Liberty and survival is at stake! I am praying for Gods blessing on our nation. But  God also gave us the ability to think for ourselves and it\u2019s time we placed blame for all this death where it belongs. The doorsteps of Nancy Pelosi  Adam Schiff and Xi Jingping directly.

In the very least  the Democrats have certainly used it politically. Can't trust them  or Communist totalitarians. Written by Bill O'Reilly China\u2019s Bio weapon  and Pelosi.. My wife Angie will tell you that I study history and world events fluently every day. I have studied China for many years. To get answers I need to questions  I call many I know in Washington on Capitol Hill (from my tenure on two Presidential campaigns and Presidential talks) and I ask them for straight up answers to better understand what affects us as a nation. Well  in 2016 America elected a new Sheriff: Donald J Trump. For decades the Chinese walked all over America but the new President said \u201cnot anymore\u201d. Trump literally strangled China\u2019s economy to the point their economy was in its worst free fall ever. Trump negotiated a new 50 billion trade agreement. He had Xi by the proverbial balls. America\u2019s economy was on fire and unstoppable. President Xi Jingping knew he could not beat the USA militarily and he knew any domesticated economic attack would fail as our economy was too strong. He had to act. But how? Enter the USA democrats led by Pelosi and Schiff. Impeachment. A hoax. A distraction for our people and President. Xi Jingping and his thugs see this. They aren\u2019t stupid. They have very intelligent intellectual thinkers in their government. Now you must understand   the Chinese regime are truly Barbarians. Notice I did not say ALL CHINESE. The Chinese people are a good people. I enjoy my interactions with them. The communist regime has millions of its own citizens slaving in gulags simply for speaking against the government or openly practicing Christianity. Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy  like a deceptive fox. In my opinion  I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn\u2019t kill everyone  but kills \u201cenough \u201d especially the elderly and in-firmed. Back in WW 2 Hitler thought the same way. He got rid of what he considered the useless and rejects of society. Trumps task force uses models to figure things. Xi used and uses \u201cmodels\u201d too. China's president figured that if he killed a few of his own (a few hundred thousand to them would be a few out of 1.4 billion people) and spread the virus to other nations (especially to the USA) they would \u201clevel the economic playing field\u201d and not have fired a shot. Losses of his own people were acceptable costs of a new war. When China\u2019s own doctors attempted to sound the warning  they were immediately silenced. In fact one died and another has simply disappeared. Trump and the other allied leaders indeed KNOW this is what happened. They have under reported their own deaths. Trump knows he cannot outrightly seek retribution. His news conference today showed me this when he balked publicly about no outright retribution over Xi\u2019s handling of this and he immediately brought up the \u201ctrade deal\u201d. However  Trump wasn\u2019t being weak  he too was now being coy. We know this was a biological weapon. The food market story is bullshit. Xi knows we know it. Trump also today announced he sent two battle groups of destroyers and other ships to sea several days ago to fight drugs and rogue actors like Iran should they try anything. I say he did this to show Xi he knows what has transpired (we have the greatest intelligence assets) and that they (the Chinese) should rethink further action. Politics is premier.

Sickness microorganisms like bacteria  viruses and fungi penetrating this limit meet macrophages that absorb viruses  kill them inside cells  and then the most specific parts of viral protein walls are displayed on the surface of macrophages (Antigen-Presenting cell). Plasma cells pick up these protein particles of viruses  absorb them  analyze the sequence of amino acids in protein  and begin the next stage of immune response until antibodies are synthesized and released into circulation. Antibodies are bleeding all over the body and where only the virus will meet it with the next destruction of the enemy. We would like to offer Autohemotherapy and medical banks as an ingredient of autohemotherapy  a forgotten but effective human immune system stimulation method (Wikipedia). Autohemotherapy was widely used in Western Europe during the preantibiotic era  and medical banks  as part of autohemotherapy  used in Eastern Europe and China as an effective method of treating infectious diseases (pneumonia  flu  koklush and surgical infections) (Wikipedia). Autohemotherapy was used as a physiologically proven method of treatment in hospitals. And medical banks used both doctors and folk healers. According to Wikipedia  autological internal blood injection increases the total number of macrophages in the body from 5 % to 22 %. Autohemotherapy is a fence of venous blood of 10 ml in the patient and the next injection of this blood inside Yazevo (old method) or inner skin (new method) (Zhongguo  J  2018) divided into 10-20 internal injections. The application of medical cans is to apply local vacuum to skin (cans) and create artificial inner and subcutaneous son with venous blood (from capillaries that have flared) and average amount of intra-skin hematoma from 3 to 5 ml of blood per can. When autohemotherapy or medical banks are used in the vermia stage  viruses present in the blood are absorbed by macrophages and initiates the start of the chain immune responses (macrophagic cells-plasma cells-clones-antibodies) with the next abortion recovery or a very easy disease leak. In the case of coronavirus  there are no vaccines today  and effective antivirus medicines  the possibility of strengthening immune response is critical for patients and workers who provide medical care. We offer autohemotherapy and especially medical banks  as an easy-to-use method  both for prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection at an early  incomprehensible stage of the disease. Our main concern is prevention. It is well known that COVID 19 or other type of coronavirus has a long as symptomatic life in the human body  and it depends on the number of viral bodies in circulating blood. When we start regularly putting medical banks to a healthy person (at least 4 banks every 3 days) and this person will get infected at a certain point in time  the number of macrophages in his tissues will be four times higher (Wikipedia) and ready to fight when the vermia comes. The next enhanced immune response to a minimum number of viral blood particles could help accumulate timely antibodies to fight the disease with minimal complications  easy progress of the disease and speedy recovery. In addition  the time of possible spread of infection will sharply decrease  which may be an important component of changing the epidemiological algorithm of the disease. Despite this  following quarantine requirements and doctor s' advice is extremely important in preventing illness and treating when you are sick. I want to stress that medical banks in the prevention of coronavirus infections are additional to existing  not tested  but only a theoretically based prevention attempt. So  dear countrymen  follow the quarantine and follow the advice of doctors in the first place. Lastly  I want to note that both glass and rubber cans can apply  and no other person (important during quarantine) and bud-which burns are excluded when applied.\nPut four banks that three days and cheers healthy \" - half jokes recommends candidate of medical sciences Andrei Khlopas\u02b9.", "comments": "8", "shares": "55", "reactions": {"all": " 46", "likes": "36", "love": "5", "wow": "4", "haha": 0, "sad": "1", "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": 5768, "checked_link": "https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/false-claim-of-deadly-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-in-africa/", "countries": "UnitedStates", "date": "2020-04-09", "justify": "explanation there are no coronavirus vaccine trials underway in africa  and no children died from such trials in senegal", "label": "FALSE", "source": " FactCheck.org", "title": " covid19 vaccine trial killed 7 children in senegal", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=covid-19-vaccine-trial-killed-7-children-in-senegal", "facebook_id": "10215820515856808", "author": "Mark Kimble", "facebook_date": "Apr 9  2020", "content": "*edit\nVaccination for COVID-19 in Senegal (West Africa)\nwas started yesterday April 8th and the first 7 children who received it died on the spot \ud83d\ude2d a friend took a screenshot before it was taken down.
