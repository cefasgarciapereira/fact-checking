(Pulmonary Thrombosis) It is now clear that the whole world has been attacking the so-called Coronavirus Pandemic wrongly due to a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error. According to valuable information from Italian pathologists  ventilators and intensive care units were never needed. Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics  antivirals  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases  that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected. However  protocols are currently being changed in Italy who have been adversely affected by this pandemic. The impressive case of a Mexican family in the United States who claimed they were cured with a home remedy was documented: three 500 mg aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey  taken hot. The next day they woke up as if nothing had happened to them! Well  the scientific information that follows proves they are right! This information was released by a medical researcher from Italy: \u201cThanks to 50 autopsies performed on patients who died of COVID-19  Italian pathologists have discovered that IT IS NOT PNEUMONIA  strictly speaking  because the virus does not only kill pneumocytes of this type  but uses an inflammatory storm to create an endothelial vascular thrombosis.\u201d In disseminated intravascular coagulation  the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed  but there is also a heart attack  stroke and many other thromboembolic diseases. In fact  the protocols left antiviral therapies useless and focused on anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting therapies. These therapies should be done immediately  even at home  in which the treatment of patients responds very well. If the Chinese had denounced it  they would have invested in home therapy  not intensive care! So  the way to fight it is with antibiotics  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan  20  that is  the Italian series is the highest in the world  the Chinese did only 3  which seems to fully confirm the information. In a nutshell  the disease is determined by a disseminated intravascular coagulation triggered by the virus; therefore  it is not pneumonia but pulmonary thrombosis  a major diagnostic error. Some world leaders doubled the number of resuscitation places in the ICU  with unnecessary exorbitant costs. According to the Italian pathologist  treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. \u201cIf we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate  it is useless  in fact  nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular  not respiratory.\u201d \u201cIt is venous microthrombosis  not pneumonia  that determines mortality.\u201d According to the literature  inflammation induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanism. Unfortunately  what the scientific literature said  especially Chinese  until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used. Now  the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics  as in influenza  and the number of hospitalized patients has been reduced. He also discovered that many deaths  even in their 40s  had a history of fever for 10 to 15 days  which were not treated properly. The inflammation does a great deal of tissue damage and creates ground for thrombus formation. However  the main problem is not the virus  but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed. In fact  patients with rheumatoid arthritis have never needed to be admitted to the ICU because they are on corticosteroid therapy  which is a great anti-inflammatory. With this important discovery  it is possible to return to normal life and open closed deals due to the quarantine  though not immediately  but with time. Kindly share so that the health authorities of each country can make their respective analysis of this information  prevent further deaths and redirect investments appropriately; the vaccine may come later. *linkedin source", "comments": "3", "shares": "19491", "reactions": {"all": 2500, "likes": 19000, "love": "110", "wow": "373", "haha": "55", "sad": "6", "angry": "36", "care": "18"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": 4041, "checked_link": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/no-covid-19-wont-respond-antibiotics-despite-findi/", "countries": "UnitedStates", "date": "2020-05-11", "justify": "explanation the novel coronavirus that causes the disease covid19 is a virus viruses do not respond to antibiotic treatment antibiotics work only on bacterial infections covid19 is primarily a respiratory illness that in some cases causes pneumonia another effect  according to the autopsies in italy  is lung damage caused by blood clotting but that doesnt change the fact that covid19 is caused by a virus", "label": "FALSE", "source": " PolitiFact", "title": " autopsies prove that covid19 is a blood clot not pneumonia and ought to be fought with antibiotics and the whole world has been wrong in treating the socalled pandemic", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=autopsies-prove-that-covid-19-is-a-blood-clot-not-pneumonia-and-ought-to-be-fought-with-antibiotics-and-the-whole-world-has-been-wrong-in-treating-the-so", "facebook_id": "3109961349024558", "author": "Susan Hazzard", "facebook_date": "May 11  2020 at 9:06 AM", "content": "Autopsies Prove that COVID-19 is a Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Pulmonary Thrombosis) It is now clear that the whole world has been attacking the so-called Coronavirus Pandemic wrongly due to a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error.

An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan  20  that is  the Italian series is the highest in the world  the Chinese did only 3  which seems to fully confirm the information. In a nutshell  the disease is determined by a disseminated intravascular coagulation triggered by the virus; therefore  it is not pneumonia but pulmonary thrombosis  a major diagnostic error. Some world leaders doubled the number of resuscitation places in the ICU  with unnecessary exorbitant costs. According to the Italian pathologist  treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. \u201cIf we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate  it is useless  in fact  nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular  not respiratory.\u201d \u201cIt is venous microthrombosis  not pneumonia  that determines mortality.\u201d According to the literature  inflammation induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanism. Unfortunately  what the scientific literature said  especially Chinese  until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used. Now  the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics  as in influenza  and the number of hospitalized patients has been reduced. He also discovered that many deaths  even in their 40s  had a history of fever for 10 to 15 days  which were not treated properly. The inflammation does a great deal of tissue damage and creates ground for thrombus formation. However  the main problem is not the virus  but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed. In fact  patients with rheumatoid arthritis have never needed to be admitted to the ICU because they are on corticosteroid therapy  which is a great anti-inflammatory. With this important discovery  it is possible to return to normal life and open closed deals due to the quarantine  though not immediately  but with time. Kindly share so that the health authorities of each country can make their respective analysis of this information  prevent further deaths and redirect investments appropriately; the vaccine may come later. *linkedin source", "comments": "3", "shares": "19491", "reactions": {"all": 2500, "likes": 19000, "love": "110", "wow": "373", "haha": "55", "sad": "6", "angry": "36", "care": "18"},

THIS IS THE MONDAY PILL [Meaning: THE OCTIMISM THAT COMES FROM KNOWN]\n11 May 2020 1. RETIREMENT CONTINUES Retreat is a bit slower than usual today  but it continues. We are therefore at the 1034th consecutive day when the total number of ICU hospitalizations for COVID-19 drops in Italy - from 1034 to 1027  then of \u2032\u2032 sun \u2032\u2032 7 units  but in the meantime we're going down and let's see how tomorrow will go. And it's important that the number of total hospital hospitalizations drops (from 13.834 to 13 618  then 216 units). While the death toll (164) is the lowest in over two months to this side - and this is certainly great news. 2. MONDAY PILL - SIEROLOGI TESTS\nConsidering that we've discussed it on other occasions  I'm reporting the Emory University paper (with eight authors from my department) describing our \u2032\u2032 serological test for COVID-19. The highlights of the study are the strong correlation between the presence of antibodies and the clinical picture  and especially the fact that - when using a good antigen  which is the key point - the ELISA title corresponds to the neutralizing title. I'm rewriting this sentence slower in case the concept escaped: THE ANTICORPES LEVEL MEASURED IN THE SIRUM WITH THE \u2032\u2032 ELISA \u2032\u2032 METHOD RUNS STRETLY WITH THE CAPACITY OF THE SERO TO NEUTRALIZE THE VIRUS *. I hope you have understood the extent of this statement  which is truly remarkable. There wasn't really anything that would make you think otherwise  as coronaviruses aren't known to break out the host's antibody response  as HIV and other viruses do. But it's one thing to predict and it's one thing to prove. Let's also bear in mind that serum neutralization doesn't necessarily mean protection from reinfection... but the two things are very  very close. Kind of like seeing a gentleman sitting in front of a nice smoking carbonara: we can't say for sure that spaghetti will soon end up in his stomach  but it's certainly very likely... The paper was posted yesterday by Jens and Mehul on MedRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20084442v1.full.pdf+html)  and it's also under review for actual publication (fingers crossed). So everyone can read it and discuss it. Two important points to remember: the first is that the subjects studied had SARS-CoV-2 disease  and it's possible that antibody levels are lower (and less able to neutralize) in subjects who had mild infection or asymptomatic. The second caveat is that we obviously don't know yet how long these antibodies will be around - I beg you  don't ask me because we don't know. Despite these limitations  the test in my opinion is a real game changer  now many are using it in the USA and around the world  we'll see. * My friend Alberto Mantovani tells me that an Italian group has unpublished data that highlights exactly the same correlation between \u2032\u2032 binding \u2032\u2032 and \u2032\u2032 neutralizing \u2032\u2032 antibodies of SARS-CoV-2-well  actually  very well  because Nothing pleases more in scientific research than independent confirmations of their own results! 3. GIVE TODAY OUR QUOTIDIAN PANIC: WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE VACCINE Today's prize goes to Il Giornale (the one founded by Montanelli  but which Montanelli has nothing left today)  which highlights the statements of a certain \u2032\u2032 professor \u2032\u2032 Baccho [\" Covid is like Hiv: not Will we ever get the vaccine \"]. Keep reading I find out that \"... Pasquale Mario Bacco  with a team of doctors  found out in February that the virus was circulating as early as last October \". Well  this would be really interesting news  ed So I thought it was important to \u2032\u2032 deepen \". So I discovered that this revolutionary research was conducted by a \u2032\u2032 colleague \u2032\u2032 whose academic affiliation is unavailable and whose PubMed publications equals ZERO. On the other hand  these studies  of which there is no trace in scientific journals  are taken from a series of web sites dedicated to no-vaxx  chemtrails and reptilians that rather spend the evening with a heavy breath mustelide. But the cutest thing about this epoch scoop is that  on the way  it goes from trippin panic to forced nano-denialism. Kinda like Nosferatu  in the middle of a bloody scene  is doing the Qua Qua dance. I quote from the article: \u2032\u2032 This virus is not capable of killing. It's a trivial  simple virus. A positive serum subject doesn't get sick with Covid  because it has HIV which is a much bigger virus using the same Coronavirus receptors  so even in the competition Covid can't get on the same receptors. Wherever there is an adequate immune response is destroyed \". In short  the virus that will never be a vaccine is destroyed by the immune system. Straight logic. I imagine that Gerolamo  Bishop of Caffa  would have called it a topic \u2032\u2032 cut like a sword \". Well come on  we've wasted enough time with this amenable \u2032\u2032 news \". [NB: The HIV genome is less than a third of SARS-CoV-2 and of course the receptors it uses (CD4  CCR4 and CXCR4) have nothing to do with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. (ACE2).] 4. THERAPY WITH PLASMA IN THE MARKS Several friends reported to me that the ethics committee that has to approve clinical trials in the Marche Region would have \u2032\u2032 denied \u2032\u2032 licensing plasma protocol for COVID-19. sufferers. The news  reported by several newspapers  sparked a certain understandable alarm. Briefly I investigated with the help of a few colleagues and found out  as I imagined  that it is NOT a rejection but a request for further clarification  which is normal practice for an ethics committee. For those who know the procedures for scientific publishing  it's not a \u2032\u2032 rejection \"  but a \u2032\u2032 revise and resubmit \". That said  I hope that colleagues on the ethics committee (where some old friends sit) can RAPIDLY approve the protocol As soon as we received the necessary clarifications  especially considering that these studies have been approved and are conducted in numerous centers around the world. 5. INFECTIONS IN MEAT Several  including friends Pier Luigi Lopalco and Elena Fattori  are taking an interest in the curious case of outbreaks of COVID-19 infection in slaughterhouse workers. This is interesting from a virological and epidemiological point of view  except for the places of care  contacts in the working environment have not usually been associated with the transmission of the virus. Hypotheses to explain the phenomenon include physical closeness between operators  low temperatures (the so-called \u2032\u2032 cold chain \u2032\u2032) and also the fact  so far considered as a curiosity  that cattle might be likely to become infected with COVID-19. virus. In this regard I remind you that other Coronavirus diseases are of veterinary interest  such as the classic acute gastroenteritis of pigs caused by TGEV  PEDV  and PDCoV  and enteritis and pneumonia caused by bovine coronavirus  BCV  which binds to the receptor for N-Acetylneuraminic acid (for friends: NANA). Let's hope that in the coming days or weeks we can clarify the causes of this strange and interesting phenomenon. 6. TOWARDS THE END... With at least the first phase of this pandemic coming to an end  the end of the \u2032\u2032 jar \u2032\u2032 of these morning optimism pills  which I tried to dispense with trust in science. Thursday afternoon I'll be back at Alberto Matano  my favorite TV conductor  for Live Life  at 18 pm on RAI UNO  and I really hope it's the last of these \u2032\u2032 appearances \"  even because that would mean mine presence is no longer necessary (and this would be a good sign for everyone). And I don't deny that I can't wait to get back into the grey gold of my laboratory and our experiments  which are delivering very fascinating results. But before we close the column  we'll still talk about COVID-19 vaccines  guessing why SARS-CoV-2 killed so many people  what I think we need to learn from this \u2032\u2032 stick \"  and - dulcis In the end -- I'll tell you how I feel about the much-loved \u2032\u2032 return to normal \u2032\u2032 With this I wish everyone a GOOD WEEK  always in the name of optimism  good mood and rationality.",

I have learned that there are many harmful effects of rebreathing Carbon Dioxide (CO2). And CO2 is a gas the body naturally produces as WASTE. We breathe in oxygen (O2) to fuel organs & tissues & the end product is CO2. The balance between these two gases is required for a healthy body. However  when we rebreathe CO2 it can have harmful & sometimes very dangerous effects on the body. When CO2 levels are elevated in the body it is known as Hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can occur for a number of reasons  one of which is rebreathing our own exhaled CO2. Rebreathing CO2 can lead to increased blood pressure  headaches  muscle twitches  rapid heart rate  chest pain  confusion  & even fatigue. In extreme cases  if left untreated  Hypercapnia can lead to organ damage & sometimes even have long standing effects on the brain. UM. HELLO ~ Upper respiratory infection - anyone!? NO TO MASKS.\n\nI only do social distancing to a certain extent  all because I respect others personal space... but not because I'm afraid of my fellow Americans  friends or my neighbors. In fact  I would gladly hug a stranger right now - in public if it was a mutual feeling. Because hugging releases endorphins which uplifts your mood & it also relieves lots of stress... and well ~ there is a whole lotta' stress going on right now in this crazy @ss world.\n\nI have never  ever gotten the flu shot because I don't believe in injecting aluminum  formaldehyde  mercury  monkey cells & aborted fetus cells (just to name a few) directly into my body  blood  muscles. No way!!! AND - I also do not want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of Coronavirus by 36%. NO THANKS!\n\nI will NOT be getting tested for Rona even if I show symptoms  because we have seen so many different stories all over the internet about the tests being contaminated with Coronavirus & now I see a cross contamination with HIV at this point. Plus  I already know they will label it Covid-19 without an actual test & I'll be added to the fake numbers that are increasing this panic all over something I may or may not truly have. I have heard from nurses themselves that say they would just tell me to go home & get some rest ...but seeeeeee  thing is -- I'm smart enough to stay home & away from people when sick or have symptoms of being sick.\n\nAND I know to wash my hands with soap & water because... well  that's just freakin' common sense.\n\nUM  I WILL NOT GET THE VACCINE! The government has never mandated a vaccine ever & I'll be damned if they force me put something in my body  that was created in less than 2 weeks of this \"outbreak\". I'm not a sheep  never will be a sheep & I refuse to be manipulated by the Gov. into thinking they have our best interest at hand. Riiiiiiiggghhht\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI believe in God. I know Jesus is my Savior. I will not live in fear  for I know that God is ultimately in control. So  if you want to stay in your house & never go out because you are \"doing the right thing\" that's fine  that's you  that ain't me though. I'm not going to let the media scare me into thinking this is some kind of mass Pandemic. That's what they want. They wanna shut this country down & here they are ~ doing it right in front of all of our faces. I will continue to go out & support locals as much as possible. I live in my life by \ud83d\ude4f Faith & not by fear.\n\nLook folks -- just start researching things. Open your eyes. Go watch:\n\"Out of Shadows\" \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=0wTiCxXgrJw\n\nYou now have all the time in the world. Please.... turn off the stupid TV & stop watching the news. Start researching from sources that have NO financial gain or conflict of interest. Then you will learn quite a bit. Then you will realize you've been lied to & manipulated your whole friggin' life.\n\nTake the blinders off \ud83d\udc40\nTIME TO WAKE UP from the deep sleep you are in!", "comments": "90", "shares": "3445", "reactions": {"all": 4500, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": 4180, "checked_link": "https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-graphic-extended-ecq-until-may-25-fake", "countries": "Philippines", "date": "2020-05-07", "justify": "explanation there has been no new announcement from authorities of a further extension of the ecq  which was first imposed on luzon last march 16 and extended till april 30", "label": "FALSE", "source": " VERA Files", "title": " a graphic shows the enhanced community quarantine in several provinces and cities in the philippines has been extended until may 25", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=a-graphic-shows-the-enhanced-community-quarantine-in-several-provinces-and-cities-in-the-philippines-has-been-extended-until-may-25", "facebook_id": "2770496803027942", "author": "Nueva Ecija TV48", "facebook_date": "April 23  2020 at 9:37 PM", "content": " JUST IN: After series of meetings  the Inter-Agency Task Force COVID-19 recommended the extension of the Enhanced Community Quarantine until May 15  2020 in Metro Manila and Central Luzon including the province of Nueva Ecija as well the other places in the country.", "comments": "962", "shares": "16613", "reactions": {"all": 5500, "likes": 30000, "love": "41", "wow": "21", "haha": "13", "sad": 23000, "angry": "14", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 4180, "checked_link": "https://verafiles.org/articles/vera-files-fact-check-graphic-extended-ecq-until-may-25-fake", "countries": "Philippines", "date": "2020-05-07", "justify": "explanation there has been no new announcement from authorities of a further extension of the ecq  which was first imposed on luzon last march 16 and extended till april 30", "label": "FALSE", "source": " VERA Files", "title": " a graphic shows the enhanced community quarantine in several provinces and cities in the philippines has been extended until may 25", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=a-graphic-shows-the-enhanced-community-quarantine-in-several-provinces-and-cities-in-the-philippines-has-been-extended-until-may-25", "facebook_id": "3291972140814015", "author": "Department of Health (Philippines)", "facebook_date": "May 6  2020 at 5:02 AM", "content": "DOH COVID-19 CASE BULLETIN #053 As of 4PM today  May 6  2020  the Department of Health reports 320 new cases (PH9685-PH10004) of COVID-19.

(KMU) and NAGKAISA are all set for the Mayday protest on May 1st despite majority of the ubran centers in the country are still placed under the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). In a media briefing via Zoom  leaders from the different labor groups have laid down the plans for the Labor Day celebration. Present are Elmer Labog  chairperson of Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU); Atty. Sonny Matula  President of NAGKAISA Chair and President of the Federation of Free Workers (FFW); Joanna Bernice Coronacion - SENTRO  Debie Faigmani  President of the Wyeth Workers\u2019 Union; Judy Miranda of NAGKAISA Women and Secretary General of Partido Manggagawa (PM); and Mylene Cabalona  President of the BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN). The demands of workers work around the theme Kalusugan  Kabuhayan  Karapatan  Ipaglaban! (Health  Livelihood  Human Rights). They also highlighted the relevance of Solusyong Medikal  HindiMilitar and Ayudang Sapat Para Sa Lahat  Mass Testing  Hindi Mass Arrest as their major campaign for the Labor Day protests. \u201cWe can\u2019t emphasize enough the urgency of government to provide immediate relief to all workers. From the President\u2019s report on the 5th week of ECQ  only about 300 000 were given financial aid out of 2million displaced workers!\u201d Labog lamented. \u201cThis is the first time in history our Labor Day protest will be like this  we are ready to go online! Despite the ECQ we will make sure Duterte hears our battlecry!\u201d Atty. Matula of FFW said. Atty. Matula also emphasised the need for income guarantee for all workers  as millions do not have income with the prevailing \u2018no work  no pay\u2019 system. Some labor groups among KMU and Nagkaisa are ready to hold noise barrages in their respective homes and localities. \u201cWe urge the government to strengthen CAMP instead of changing to SBWS. In CAMP  there is flexibility on the part of workers. All you need is an ID and payslip to avail of the financial aid  while in SBWS  your employer has to be compliant first with SSS and BIR. It\u2019s very restrictive\u201d Judy Miranda of Nagkaisa Women added. On the part of the BPO workers  they noted that several companies have violated ECQ guidelines and does not have enough health safety protocols in ensuring physical distancing is observed. BIEN Philippines has recorded several BPO workers being infected by COVID19 and no mass testing has been conducted to workers. In one company Cebu City  three BPO workers were positive of COVID while present at work and no immediate action were given by the company. \u201cThis is a manifestation that our efforts to keep the economy alive means nothing to this government. We are neglected and DOLE has admitted they are not aware of the working conditions of BPO workers\u201d Cabana said. On the part of formal sector workers  majority of them are considered as essential workers since they are in the food manufacturing sector. Despite this  no safety guarantees were put in place to ensure testing and quarantine procedures. \u201cNakakabahala  we go to work but we don\u2019t know if we contracted the virus since we have don\u2019t have enough medical support from our employers and the government. Kahit thermal scanner and mass testing  wala\u201d Faigmani added. For SENTRO\u2019s part  Nice Coronation states  \u201cWe need to build up our public health system now; and to to that  we need to have at least 10 percent of the GDP budget be allotted to health. We need to hire more full time health workers with proper remuneration and full protection \u201d \u201cECQ or no ECQ  tuloy ang Laban! No threat of Martial Law will stop us from reaching out to the largest sector of workers. We will make sure Duterte will hear the loudest bang of our hammers and the clamor of workers across the country!\u201d Labog said. KMU and NAGKAISA will hold various forms of actions nationwide both online and offline on May First. #RedLaborDay2020", "comments": "71", "shares": "146", "reactions": {"all": " 305", "likes": "238", "love": "54", "wow": "9", "haha": "3", "sad": 0, "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 4501, "checked_link": "https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/gowdy-didnt-author-viral-conspiracy-theory/", "countries": "UnitedStates", "date": "2020-04-30", "justify": "explanation rep trey gowdy confirmed that he did not write the post in question", "label": "FALSE", "source": " FactCheck.org", "title": " former rep trey gowdy wrote essay past on social media claiming the covid19 pandemic was planned to help democrats in the 2020 election", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=former-rep-trey-gowdy-wrote-essay-past-on-social-media-claiming-the-covid-19-pandemic-was-planned-to-help-democrats-in-the-2020-election", "facebook_id": "2406222282936001", "author": "", "facebook_date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 4501, "checked_link": "https://www.factcheck.org/2020/05/gowdy-didnt-author-viral-conspiracy-theory/", "countries": "UnitedStates", "date": "2020-04-30", "justify": "explanation rep trey gowdy confirmed that he did not write the post in question", "label": "FALSE", "source": " FactCheck.org", "title": " former rep trey gowdy wrote essay past on social media claiming the covid19 pandemic was planned to help democrats in the 2020 election", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=former-rep-trey-gowdy-wrote-essay-past-on-social-media-claiming-the-covid-19-pandemic-was-planned-to-help-democrats-in-the-2020-election", "facebook_id": "732343543965610", "author": "Recall Tony Evers", "facebook_date": "March 13  2020 at 3:57 PM", "content": "Thoughts on this?

Stock market tumbles  companies are laying off employees  everything is closed and cancelled ect. Now they say there are a couple ways a President doesn't win reelection. Those are an unpopular war or a poor economy. I can't help but think there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment. Especially the fact that it originated in China who we are in a global trade war with brought on by Trump. I am sure China doesn't want 4 more years of Trump either. I am not a conspiracy theorist but it all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election.

into the sky and observe the ongoing processes there.

It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all  after the Coronavirus surfaced. But all their phones are dead for the last 3 months. It is now understood that all these lab technicians have died.\n\nBased on all my knowledge and research till date  I can say this with 100% confidence - That the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it. If what I am saying today is proved false now or even after my death  the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize.
