CEO of disney stepped down CEO of Tinder  Hinge  OKcupid  Match all stepped down CEO of Hulu stepped down CEO of MedMen stepped down CEO of L brands like Victoria Secret bath and body works stepped down CEO of Salesforce's stepped down CEO of Harley Davidson stepped down CEO of IBM stepped down CEO of T Mobile stepping down CEO of LinkedIn stepping down CEO of Mastercard is stepping down And soooooo many more  but let's just stick with these that most know about. Weird they stepped down right before \"Corona Virus scare\" almost like they all knew it was coming \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Following it stocks seen their biggest crash in recorded history  worse than great depression or the early 2000s hit  crypto markets started following suit. And governments are shutting things down left and right. \"Corona virus omg!\" This was a planned epidemic that needed a face to it for the masses to follow it blindly like the blind sheep the majority is. This was planned for decades in advance with many short \"scares\" coming like Ebola and the countless other \"epidemics\" to prepare the human mind for the grand finale \"CoronaVirus\" omg! It is nothing more than a face. \"But cody! All the governments are on it!\" The world is all a 1 world government for the major part  you just been to blind to see it. This is larger than an attack on the elections This is larger than an attack on china as a global manufacturing hub. This is larger than an attack on a single economy like the united states who just entered their largest economic collapse that will make the great depression look like a joke. This is the forced introduction into a new era. The online world. Following this will be mass closures of brick and mortar stores The largest housing market collapse to date. A huge shift in power and money on a global scale. The largest lay off of jobs  because they have been a scam for so long  now they are finally going away. This is all to make room for the largest influx of automation coming. Malls will turn into warehouses and shipping facilities. Big department stores as well. This is the rise of virtual sports and the first test of a mass market of it. Virtual reality is about to be massively introduced. This is a massive shift off offline to online. Of manual labor to automation. \"Omg corona virus!\" Keep thinking that. Your the first to go when this mass extinction comes  because it is coming. Homeless rates will hit all time highs. Foreclosures will hit all time highs. Lay offs will hit all time highs. Stores will run out of food and necessities. Those who didnt prepare for this wont get help as there wont be anything to help them with. America will be hit hardest  because americans well... let's face it  some of the laziest people on planet earth  just facts. They dont prepare they just react  and reacting wont help you in this case. If you dont already have automated income  work from home stuff going  and I mean work from home for yourself  not a company  in other words  your not collecting a paycheck  then your too late and better start finding anway online get it and learn it because it will be your best bet. You can see this as the worlds largest economic collapse  you would be right. Nothing will compare to thos one. You can see this as the begining of world war 3  you are probably right on that  but it wont look anything like world war 1 or 2  it is done much differently with media control  fear introduction  and using \"the people\" as the weapon. Control the people  control anything u want. And media has conditioned people to not be able to think for themselves for this exact moment. You can see this as the next black plague and your probably right  but it wont have to do with corona virus again. It's just the face of this. I could make this post go on forever. But let's keep it at that. Share this  wake up  now is not the time to play games  to take a break  to sit at home. No one is safe from what is to come  and that is why the CEOs stepped down  they know it's time to prepare for something much bigger than themselves and had warning before any of us. The elite always have the upper hand. Share this. And let's wake up to what is truly happening Prepare For The Storm Q\n\"Here is some inside info you won't hear on the news: This morning  at 4:30AM  our\u2026 More  ", "comments": "11000", "shares":

Academia Sinica develops antibodies for rapid immune-based test kit of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Currently available RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus diagnostic tests take about 4 hours to obtain results  with throughput limited by availability of laboratory facilities and trained personnel. To prevent the pandemic spread of the coronavirus  a faster way to detect infected patients is urgently needed. Today  Academia Sinica (AS) proudly announced that the first group of monoclonal antibodies specifically binding the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) has been successfully generated and tested by Dr. An-Suei Yang and his team at the Genomics Research Center in AS. If successfully manufactured and validated  the rapid immune-based test kit could detect coronavirus in only 15 minutes  just like a rapid influenza test. His team produced N proteins from 7 different viral species and screened against these to obtain a few dozen monoclonal antibodies. Out of these few dozen  one antibody against only SARS-CoV-2 N protein  9 against only SARS-CoV N protein  and 36 against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV N proteins were developed. One additional advantage  said Dr. Yang  is that none of these monoclonal antibodies bind any N proteins of the other 5 strains of coronavirus  thus cross-reactivity will not be a problem for the rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. With the help of the Ministry of Economic Affairs  Dr. Yang\u2019s team is working with manufacturers on the development and production of prototypes. In the coming months  they will discuss product validation and certification with the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. They will then work with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to bring a rapid coronavirus test kit to Taiwan to combat this devastating epidemic. #coronavirus #Rapidvirusdetection #antibody #SARSCoV2",

Academia Sinica develops antibodies for rapid immune-based test kit of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Currently available RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus diagnostic tests take about 4 hours to obtain results  with throughput limited by availability of laboratory facilities and trained personnel. To prevent the pandemic spread of the coronavirus  a faster way to detect infected patients is urgently needed. Today  Academia Sinica (AS) proudly announced that the first group of monoclonal antibodies specifically binding the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) has been successfully generated and tested by Dr. An-Suei Yang and his team at the Genomics Research Center in AS. If successfully manufactured and validated  the rapid immune-based test kit could detect coronavirus in only 15 minutes  just like a rapid influenza test. His team produced N proteins from 7 different viral species and screened against these to obtain a few dozen monoclonal antibodies. Out of these few dozen  one antibody against only SARS-CoV-2 N protein  9 against only SARS-CoV N protein  and 36 against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV N proteins were developed. One additional advantage  said Dr. Yang  is that none of these monoclonal antibodies bind any N proteins of the other 5 strains of coronavirus  thus cross-reactivity will not be a problem for the rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. With the help of the Ministry of Economic Affairs  Dr. Yang\u2019s team is working with manufacturers on the development and production of prototypes. In the coming months  they will discuss product validation and certification with the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. They will then work with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to bring a rapid coronavirus test kit to Taiwan to combat this devastating epidemic. #coronavirus #Rapidvirusdetection #antibody #SARSCoV2",

Hiding important public health information from their workers is dangerous. This clearly shows that most bosses and managers don't care about the lives of their workers or their customers. They only care about making profits and they will doom the whole world to put an extra penny in their pockets.\nThat's why universal paid sick leave is essential. If we leave it up to employers  they will ALWAYS choose the option that puts their workers in harm's way.

Corona virus is large where cell diameter is 400 mic and for this reason any mask prevents entry  so pharmacists are not required to exchange muzzles.

Coronavirus when it comes across a metal surface  it will live 12 hours  so wash hands enough with soap and water. The Corona virus when it comes across the cloth remains 9 hours  so washing clothes or being exposed to the sun for two hours aims to kill it. The virus lives on its hands for 10 minutes  so putting a liquor sterilizer in the pocket meets the goal of prevention. If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27\u00b0C  it will be killed because it does not live in the hot areas. Also drinking hot water and sun exposure will do\nAnd stay away from ice cream and cold is important. Gargling with warm and salty water kills tonsils germs and prevents them from fleeing into the lungs. Compliance with these instructions fulfills the goal of virus prevention.

This disease treats us all equally  perhaps we should to. If you don\u2019t believe me  just ask Tom Hanks. - It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another. It is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport. It is reminding us  by oppressing us for a short time  of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression. - It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals. If we don\u2019t look after our health  we will  of course  get sick. - It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do  which is to help each other  especially those who are old or sick. Our purpose is not to buy toilet roll. - It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how  when in times of difficulty  we remember that it\u2019s the essentials that we need (food  water  medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to. - It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this. It is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and to strengthen our family unit. - It is reminding us that our true work is not our job  that is what we do  not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other  to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. - It is reminding us to keep our egos in check. It is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are  a virus can bring our world to a standstill. - It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands. We can choose to cooperate and help each other  to share  to give  to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish  to hoard  to look after only our self. Indeed  it is difficulties that bring out our true colours. - It is reminding us that we can be patient  or we can panic. We can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass  or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and  consequently  cause ourselves more harm than good. - It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning. This can be a time of reflection and understanding  where we learn from our mistakes  or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to. - It is reminding us that the true heroes are not the movie stars or sports stars that we put on a pedestal  but the doctors  nurses  care-workers etc. that dedicate their lives to helping people on a daily basis. - It is reminding us that this Earth is sick. It is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick. - It is reminding us that after every difficulty  there is always ease. Life is cyclical  and this is just a phase in this great cycle.

As he has emphasized time and again  he has complete trust and confidence in the opinion of the Vaccine Expert Panel and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as they are science-based  and will follow their recommendations on the vaccines we shall be procuring and administering to our people. We shall also wait for the deliberations of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) on the priority list of recipients so that we shall be guided accordingly. We advise the public to refrain from sharing this social media card and be critical of all posts you will see online. This kind of manufactured quote does not only malign the image of the Vaccine Czar  but is also sowing confusion  distrust and fear among our people.
