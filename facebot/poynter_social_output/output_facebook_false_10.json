Upon verification  the photos concerned were actually circulated online back in 2018. As the entire society is fighting hard together against the epidemic  it is regrettable that ill-intentioned people once again disseminated bogus information to discredit the Force  incite hatred towards Police officers and create divisive views in the society. The Police stress that each Government department is supplied with its share of face masks in accordance to its functions. In fact  the current amount of protective gears such as face masks and protective clothing given to front-line Police officers can barely meet their daily operational needs  and the Force has not hoarded any internal resources. The Police has been frugal and prudent in utilizing their finite supplies  and will ensure that emergency services provided to citizens remain unaffected under existing circumstances. \u5e02\u6c11\u5831\u6599\uff0c\u5927\u9678\u9109\u97f3\u5973\u515c\u552e\u653f\u5e9cCSI\u53e3\u7f69\uff0c\u5357\u660c\u7ad9\u5c0d\u51fa\uff0c\u958b\u50f9$180\u4e00\u76d2\n\u653f\u5e9c\u903e\u5104\u53e3\u7f69\u9001\u5497\u4e0a\u5927\u9678\uff0c\u5572\u4eba\u4ef2\u8981\u62ce\u756a\u9999\u6e2f\u8ce3\n\u9999\u6e2f\u653f\u5e9c\u7121\u62c9\u904e\u4e00\u500b\u4eba\uff0c\u9ede\u89e3\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec6\u8857\u5230\u5481\uff1f\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\n\u6b61\u8fce\u52a0\u5165\u5831\u6599 => \u6b66\u6f22\u80ba\u708e\u5831\u6599\u5340(\u9999\u6e2f\u4eba\u8a0e\u8ad6\u5340)", "comments": "37000", "shares": "569", "reactions": {"all": 6400, "likes": 40000, "love": "57", "wow": "68", "haha": "587", "sad": "43", "angry": 16000, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 9128, "checked_link": "https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/girl-suspected-to-be-suffering-from-corona-virus-infection-discharged/", "countries": "SriLanka", "date": "2020-02-09", "justify": "explanation the girl tested negative for coronavirus she was treated and then discharged", "label": "False", "source": " FactCrescendo", "title": " a coronavirusinfected girl was admitted to badulla hospital in sri lanka", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=a-coronavirus-infected-girl-was-admitted-to-badulla-hospital-in-sri-lanka", "facebook_id": "2500882663532704", "author": "Nethuki Wikramasingha", "facebook_date": "February 6  2020 at 6:06 AM", "content": " 21 years old young girls who are infected with corona are hospitalized in Badulla..", "comments": "0", "shares": "1", "reactions": {"all": " 22", "likes": "21", "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": 9128, "checked_link": "https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/girl-suspected-to-be-suffering-from-corona-virus-infection-discharged/", "countries": "SriLanka", "date": "2020-02-09", "justify": "explanation the girl tested negative for coronavirus she was treated and then discharged", "label": "False", "source": " FactCrescendo", "title": " a coronavirusinfected girl was admitted to badulla hospital in sri lanka", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=a-coronavirus-infected-girl-was-admitted-to-badulla-hospital-in-sri-lanka", "facebook_id": "2500882663532704", "author": "Nethuki Wikramasingha", "facebook_date": "February 6  2020 at 6:06 AM", "content": " 21 years old young girls who are infected with corona are hospitalized in Badulla..", "comments": "0", "shares": "1", "reactions": {"all": " 22", "likes": "21", "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": 9128, "checked_link": "https://srilanka.factcrescendo.com/english/girl-suspected-to-be-suffering-from-corona-virus-infection-discharged/", "countries": "SriLanka", "date": "2020-02-09", "justify": "explanation the girl tested negative for coronavirus she was treated and then discharged", "label": "False", "source": " FactCrescendo", "title": " a coronavirusinfected girl was admitted to badulla hospital in sri lanka", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=a-coronavirus-infected-girl-was-admitted-to-badulla-hospital-in-sri-lanka", "facebook_id": "110919583752333", "author": "", "facebook_date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 9139, "checked_link": "https://factcheck.afp.com/thai-department-health-denies-authorising-face-mask-infographic-after-novel-coronavirus-outbreak", "countries": "Thailand", "date": "2020-02-07", "justify": "explanation ministry of health denied this", "label": "False", "source": " AFP", "title": " thai department of health published an infographic on how to properly wear face masks", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=thai-department-of-health-published-an-infographic-on-how-to-properly-wear-face-masks", "facebook_id": "2775139215939800", "author": "\u0e01\u0e23\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e32\u0e21\u0e31\u0e22", "facebook_date": "February 2  2020 at 2:22 AM", "content": " Due to the source of the Department of Health  there is no authentication yet.

MERS  or other coronviruses using recombined viruses  they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.\n\n\"The implications are clear: if China sensitized their population via a SARS vaccine  and this escaped from a lab  the rest of world has a serious humanitarian urgency to help China  but may not expect as serious an epidemic as might otherwise be expected.\n\n\"In the worst-case scenario  if the vaccination strain is more highly contagious and lethal  2019-nCoV could become the worst example of vaccine-derived contagious disease in human history.

It has been around for at least two decades and is transmitted from animals to humans and then from humans to humans. It is said to have originated from eating cats  bats  and camels (depending on the strain). 2019-nCoV is a supposedly new strain of the coronavirus that surfaced in mid-December 2019 from a seafood market in China. Now follow with me: In 2004  the CDC filed a patent on a newly isolated coronavirus known as SARS-CoV. It expired on January 24  2020 -- pure coincidence given the timing of this media outbreak I'm sure. In 2015  the Pirbright Institute filed a patent for a live attenuated coronavirus to be used in the production of vaccines. The Pirbright Institute is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and recently received $5.5 million dollars to do what they do. They were \"coincidentally chosen\" to create the vaccine behind this current outbreak. They will be partnering with Inovio Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) to create said vaccine. This company brought you the zika quackxine in a record-breaking 7 months (run ... just ... run). Inovio Pharmaceuticals will be partnering with Wistar (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates)  GeneOne (funded by Bill and Melinda Gates and sponsored by the US FDA) and Twist Biosciences (funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). If the Wistar Institute sounds familiar  it should. This is the company that produced the WI-38 cell line derived from the \"too many to count\" aborted fetuses in the vaccines injected into your children. In October of 2019  the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health (Center for Health Security) held \"Event 201 \" which simulated an outbreak of a theoretical coronavirus that ironically  looks exactly like what's playing out right now. It ultimately becomes a childhood disease for which we need to vaccinate against. Guess who it was funded by? The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. You really can't make this stuff up.

Main cause of death: multiple organs failure. This deviates wildly from the number of PUBLICLY reported 830 infected and 25 dead because. .... ready for this one. .... .... A message from a frontline doctor in Wuhan has confirmed that the reason the increasing number of infected people has been arrested is due to hospitals running out of virus test kits... Thousands of deaths are taken directly to incinerators. No funeral at all. No burial. Just burnt out. Intel is getting its actual death counts directly from incinerator workers!!!!!! People are literally \u2032\u2032 Dropping Dead \". On trains (before quarantine): On the streets: And here: And also here: On hospital plans awaiting treatment: Now even hospital doctors are literally falling to the ground dead: The new virus is different from SARS as it causes rapid renal failure.

Archpriest John M. Fields  our Communications and Religious Education Director  passed away. Please say a prayer for the blessed repose of his soul. -------------- I regret to inform our bishops  priests  religious  and faithful that Father John Fields has passed away in his home. The cause of death is yet to be determined. Father John was born in 1950 and this year in February celebrated his 70th birthday. Among the numerous services that Father John rendered to the Church was ministry as long-time pastor and  in recent years  Religious Education and Communications Director of our Archeparchy. Father John had many assignments in different parishes and various capacities throughout our Archeparchy. A lawyer by first profession  Father John had a bright and inquisitive mind. He was a builder of churches  an avid conversationalist  a communicator. Animated  quick-witted  and with an incisive sense of humor Father John kept us alert. He loved to share news and was adept at doing so. Father John was an ardent American patriot and a proud carrier of the legacy of his Pennsylvania coal mining homeland. There is nothing that he loved more than sharing stories of the people  parishes  and past of our Anthracite region. He remained hopeful about the future  that of the Church  the country  and his own ability to make a contribution. In our last conversation before Thanksgiving Father John was in good spirits and seemingly improving in his health. I express my heartfelt condolences to Father John's family and friends. As Father John professed and preached  our hope is in the Lord and His Resurrection. At this time the funeral arrangements have not been finalized. Let us remember him in our grateful prayers. May his memory be eternal.\n\u0412\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0430\u043c'\u044f\u0442\u044c!\n+Borys", "comments": "16", "shares": "6", "reactions": {"all": " 55", "likes": "10", "love": 0,

The CBC that was done at his arrival showed his platelet count to be 0 (A normal platelet count ranges from 150 000 to 450 000 platelets per microliter of blood.) he was admitted in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute ITP caused by a reaction to the COVID vaccine. A team of expert doctors tried for 2 weeks to raise his platelet count to no avail. Experts from all over the country were involved in his care. No matter what they did  the platelets count refused to go up. He was conscious and energetic through the whole process but 2 days before a last resort surgery  he got a hemorrhagic stroke caused by the lack of platelets that took his life in a matter of minutes.\nHe was a pro vaccine advocate that is why he got it himself.\nI believe that people should be aware that side effects can happened  that it is not good for everyone and in this case destroyed a beautiful life  a perfect family  and has affected so many people in the community\nDo not let his death be in vain please save more lives by making this information news.", "comments":

The country's constitutional court found abortion illegal  even if there is a violation of the fetus threatening the child's life. That is  now the only reasons for legal abortion in Poland can be confirmed the threat to mother's life and the pregnancy as a result of rape. And rallies against such a decision in Poland continue still. What was the situation with abortion in Poland before the ban \u2753 In 1993  the Catholic church under the slogan \u2032\u2032 do not kill \u2032\u2032 prolob\u00ed yu the ban of abortion for social reasons. That's how a woman doesn't want to have children or is in a tight material situation. (https://nyti.ms/34yInQj) Since then  there have been three factors that could serve as a reason for abortion:\n\u25aa threat to mother's life \n\u25aa violation of the fetus development \n\u25aa pregnancy due to rape. \u2757 But back then  in 1993  Polish gynecologists and public figures discouraged that those women who want to have an abortion would do it themselves  underground or go to neighboring countries. Over time  these disclaimers have come true  and the terms of \u2032\u2032 abortion tourism \u2032\u2032 and \u2032\u2032 underground abortion \u2032\u2032 have become usual for Poland. !! Women's rights groups estimate that every year between 80 and 120 thousand Polish women leave the country to abortion. And it's a rocking difference when compared to last year's number of legally conducted abortions that were about a thousand (https://bbc.in/3oAjg7A). Subsequently  20 years after the preliminary ban  in 2016  Polish Sejm deputies adopted a bill banning all abortion in the country - except cases of direct threat to mother's life. This norm was supported by the church again. And he had to introduce criminal liability for all involved in abortion  meaning both a doctor and a woman who applied for the procedure. But the norm was never adopted permanently and constantly withdrawn from parliament due to protests and statements of human rights organizations. Now  to introduce a new ban on abortion  they used not the legislative branch of power  but the judiciary. Deputies - in particular from the power political force \u2032\u2032 Right and Justice \u2032\u2032 - appealed to the Constitutional Court. And he declared abortion unconstitutional in cases of \u2032\u2032 violation of the fetus development \"  that is  life threat to the future child. Court arguments - the Constitution of Poland protects the right to life of an unborn child. Polish civil society representatives comment that another abortion ban will increase \u2032\u2032 abortion \u2032\u2032 in neighboring countries - in case a woman has funds. Or it will contribute even more to underground abortion. In any case  the situation of women in society becomes less protective: women who intend to have an abortion but cannot go abroad often fall victim to poor medical services. \u26ea All these prohibitions occur not only against the background of very conservative views of Polish society: almost 95 % of Poles are believers and over 60 % say religion occupies an important or very important place for them in life. (https://bit.ly/3jsGetO) \ud83c\udfdb Another aspect is also the \u2032\u2032 judicial reform \u2032\u2032 of the current government. It gives the executive branch a significant impact on the courts. The EU has already stated that such changes are questionable in system independence (https://bit.ly/35zWynA) Furthermore  newly appointed judges had political past - including two of them were parliamentarians from the law and justice party  which promoted such changes regarding abortion in Poland.

We are not aware of any evidence that suggests that the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted to humans via food or food packaging and equipment.

SFA will continue to monitor developments closely and promptly take any necessary actions to safeguard food safety in Singapore. The environment that we interact with can be easily contaminated with the COVID-19 virus. In general  contact with food or food packaging and equipment is no different from contact with other non-food packaging and the environment (e.g. common touch surfaces such as lift buttons  door knobs  etc). As such  SFA continues to emphasise the importance of good public and personal hygiene practices to uphold a high level of public health standards in Singapore.
