Especially those who are playing \u2032\u2032 second wave \u2032\u2032 again of quarantine\nNow this is a common tool for use for useful purposes.\nAnd in Ukraine  did any specialists and scientists express their opinion against of quarantine?\nHaven't met.\nOnly we make noise on the expanses of FB.\nI read it myself  let's go to friends. Opinion of Scientists:\nquarantine is useless. \u2032\u2032 You can deceive some people all the time  and all the people for a while  but you can't lie all the time.\"-Abraham Lincoln. After 3 months after the announcement of the pandemic  even people far from science begin to understand that the pandemic and quarantine have non-medical goals  Sergey Perelegin said this back in March [11] Today  the words of honest scientists who are being silent are with special power  because they are really inconvenient for the organizers of a disaster called quarantine and the blockage of the economy. \u2022 A study of scientists at Blavatnik University School on Efficiency of quarantine showed that the reduction of virus mortality quarantine was useless  but it was extremely effective for economic destruction. [1] \u2022 Epidemiology professor Sunetra Gupta from Oxford University said: We would have more success in epidemiological protection if we hadn't introduced quarantine [2] \u2022 Doctor of Medicine Nikolai Filatov from the Institute of Vaccines and Serums named after. Mechnikova said that quarantine is a useless measure  and Covid19 is the most common infection. In Moscow  about 3 million people get flu annually  more fatalities than from coronavirus  but we never said that the flu was a disaster and did not lock people up. Natural immunization of the population will pass  and everything will end. [3] \u2022 Camilla Stoltenberg  Director of the Norwegian Health Institute  stated uselessness of quarantine: \u2032\u2032 After examining the actual virus spread statistics before and after the introduction of of quarantine  we concluded that of quarantine could and should have been avoided with more focused measures.\" [4 ] \u2022 Professor Eran Segal from the Weitzman Institute in Israel said the government is misleading people  talking about the advent of a second wave of the virus. This is not the second wave  this is not the end of the first wave that the government artificially stretched with of quarantine [5] \u2022 A study of scientists from the University of East England showed that a tough quarantine introduced in many countries had hardly benefited  but destroyed the economy. Scientists recommend restricting only mass clusters of people and continue to avoid quarantine. [6] https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-opinion-coronavirus-europe-lockdown-excess-deaths-recession/ \u2022 A study by scientists from the University College of London found that closing schools for quarantine has hardly affected the rate of virus spread. This measure helped prevent up to 2 % of all deaths. But the expenditures that the state and population of different countries were very significant. The closure of schools has negatively impacted the mental and physical health of children forced to sit in apartments for a day. Family savings have decreased seriously. [7] \u2022 Mathematics professor Itzhak Ben Israel from Tel Aviv University investigated the dynamics of virus spread in the USA  Britain  Sweden  Italy  Israel  Switzerland  France  Germany and Spain. Numbers showed that whether the country was placed in quarantine or lived a normal life  the coronavirus peaked at six weeks and remained silent by eight. Professor concludes: quarantine and blocking the economy is not justified and should be replaced with moderate social distancing. Every year  about 4500 people die from the flu and its complications in Israel  but we never declared quarantine (Certificate: 300 victims of Covid19 in Israel were 2020  28 of them died from Covid19  the rest of them from chronic diseases  having a positive test) [8] \u2022 WHO representative Maria Van Kerkhov said that governments should have limited the isolation of infected people with symptoms. That is  that quarantine  destroyed economy  destroyed families  businesses and lives were all unnecessary. [9] \u2022 WHO praised Sweden  whose population is now more immune than quarantine countries. Countries that have not introduced quarantine (Japan  South Korea  Sweden  Belarus  Turkmenistan) have not experienced negative development of events related to Karatnin. [10] Links: 1.

Middle roots are also closed..! Many villages in Kandy sealed..! 300 suspected deaths and 500 were burnt in bodybags..! (Sri Lanka e News-2020. May. 02  a. m. 7.40) Even though the government tried to shut down  the corona epidemic is spreading severely across Sri Lanka. Providing the best evidence for that  the Madamulana area of Weeraketiya  which was the village of Rajapakshala  has been completely closed today. The reason for this is that 9 corona infected people were found in that area. In addition to the south's Medamulana  Walasmulla  four-road areas have also been closed. 2 corona infected people have been found in the four road area. The most reason for the closure of the above areas is that the found infected were walking around the village. In addition  Central Province is the most endangered by now. A large number of infections have been found in the Kandy district of Central Province and many villages have been completely closed last night as they have also walked in many places. They are  in the area of Pathahewa sixty\nPuliyedda  Nahinawala  Nahinawala North  Katawala  Thalathuoya  Dambawela North  Bawulana  Kandakula  Villages  In Kandy district \nPoojapitiya  Bokkawela  Ambakka  Hirassagala  Ampitiya  Nugawela  Gampola  Nawalapitiya road junction  Akurana  Wattagedara  Madawala (3 infected found)  Ukgahakumbura  Valdeniya  Moragaha hill  Gamhatha  Siyabalapitiya  Pussadeniya  Four Liyadda Pradda The area is the one who is the one who is 117 people from the previous Thalathuoya area have been taken to Punani camp for quarantine and 19 of them have been confirmed corona positive. As there have been a number of infected people from the above areas  the decision has been made to close these areas according to the recommendations made by the public health officials to the police to close these areas. Suspected deaths 500-JJ. Ni. Inspector of Police / Death 300-Zonal Medical Director\n-------------------------------\nMeanwhile  unofficial reports say that the death toll which was suspected to be Corona and performed as per the Corona asset is much higher than the government says. A senior deputy inspector who couldn't disclose the name he commented on Lanka e News said that  according to his knowledge  more than 500 such deaths have occurred across the country. Meanwhile  Hambantota Zonal Director Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa  is noting on a social network that more than 300 suspected corona deaths have occurred islandwide. Chamal Sanjeewa doctor  who also claims that all the dead bodies were cremated using safe container bags  says he is revealing the truth as per a request made by Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake  the director in charge of the Central Pharmaceutical Store. The stupid government should understand that lies are not a vaccine for any virus. People should be wise not to accept the lies of the government and risk their lives by considering the epidemic as small as possible. - By a staff reporter of Sri Lanka e News -", "comments": "0", "shares": "29", "reactions": {"all": " 57", "likes": "45", "love": "1", "wow": "1", "haha": 0, "sad": "10", "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 10339, "checked_link": "http://mythdetector.ge/ka/myth/gvpirdeba-tu-ara-bil-geitsi-depopulatsias-da-chipizatsias", "countries": "Georgia", "date": "2020-04-29", "justify": "explanation bill gates quote is taken out of context he discussed production of vaccines to reduce the death rate of children in developing countries", "label": "misleading", "source": " Myth Detector", "title": " bill gates is creating vaccines to make the earths population infertile he discussed a plan to reduce the worlds population through vaccines during his 2010 ted talk", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=bill-gates-is-creating-vaccines-to-make-the-earths-population-infertile-he-discussed-a-plan-to-reduce-the-worlds-population-through-vaccines-during-his-2010-ted-talk", "facebook_id": "1510968955872507", "author": "", "facebook_date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 10356, "checked_link": "https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/estadao-verifica/video-usa-informacoes-falsas-para-dizer-que-lockdown-foi-inutil-e-pico-de-covid-19-ficou-para-tras/", "countries": "Brazil", "date": "2020-05-01", "justify": "explanation the study cited was published by professor at the university of tel aviv isaac benisrael on his personal facebook account however  other studies claim the opposite  as imperial college london and johns hopkins university official data in brazil also shows that peak is not over the author makes several false statements throughout the video", "label": "misleading", "source": " Estad\u00e3o Verifica", "title": " a video that claims that covid19s peak is over and lockdown was useless the statement is based on an israeli study", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=a-video-that-claims-that-covid-19s-peak-is-over-and-lockdown-was-useless-the-statement-is-based-on-an-israeli-study", "facebook_id": "776620817", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "facebook_date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 10350, "checked_link": "https://www.open.online/2020/04/29/coronavirus-morti-di-polmonite-o-trombosi-colpa-del-virus-oppure-no-ecco-cosa-e-cambiato-in-un-mese/", "countries": "Italy", "date": "2020-04-29", "justify": "explanation some patients died of thrombosis  it is a complication due to the virus circulating in the body", "label": "Misleading", "source": " Open", "title": " the real cause of death is not pneumonia but thrombosis the virus is not a problem", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=the-real-cause-of-death-is-not-pneumonia-but-thrombosis-the-virus-is-not-a-problem", "facebook_id": "10219859890800793", "author": "Claudio Zanoni", "facebook_date": "April 22  2020 at 3:42 AM", "content": "            From Dr. Giampaolo Palma\nHUMANITAS GROUP COVID-19 UPDATE\nON 10 April 2020: TRUTH!!!\nNOT INTERSTITIAL POLMONITE\nDISCOVERED DISCOVERED ERROR ONLY AFTER 50 AUTOPSIES!\nMy dearest friends \nI don't mean to sound excessive  but I think today  finally  is certain the cause of the lethality of Covid-19.\nMy 200.000-year experience in Echocardiography-Echocolordopplergraphy Vascular with more than 200.000 cardiopathic patients and not  makes me confirm what some were assuming  but couldn't be sure. Today we have the first data.\nPatients go to CPR for Generalized Venous Thromboembolism  especially TEP Pulmonary Thromboembolia.\nIf so  CPR and intubation are useless because first and foremost you have to dissolve the thrombus  actually prevent these thromboembolies. If you ventilate a lung where the blood isn't coming  it's not necessary! In fact 9 out of 10. patients die\nGentlemen  Covid1 9 damages first of all the vases  the cardiovascular apparatus  and only then it gets to the lungs!!!\nIt's venous microthrombosis  not pneumonia that determine fatality! And why are trumpets forming? Because inflammation as per school text  induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known physiopathological mechanism. So what  then? What scientific literature  especially Chinese  said until mid-March  was that anti-inflammatories should not be used. Now in Italy we use anti-inflammatories and antibiotics (as in influences) and the number of hospitalized people collapsed.\nMany deaths  even 40 years old  had a history of high fever for 10-15 days not properly cured. Inflammation here destroyed everything and prepared the ground for trumpet formation. Because the main problem isn't the virus  but the immune reaction that destroys the cells where the virus enters. In fact in all departments\nCOVID never came in sick with rheumatoid arthritis and that's because I'm in cortison therapy. This is the main reason why hospitalizations in Italy are starting to decrease and it's becoming a treatable disease at home. By taking care of her well at home  you avoid not only hospitalization  but also thrombotic risk. It wasn't easy to understand because the signs of microembolism are faded  even in the eye of an echocardiologist.\nComparing the data of the first 50 patients between those who breathe badly and those who don't  the situation has become very clear to all doctors in Italy  from cardiologists  radiologists  to anatom-pathologists and to colleagues in Intensive Therapies.\nTime to publish these data and you could start getting the population out of quarantine  not immediately  but shorter than expected.\nIn USA where anti-inflammatories are still prohibited  data is now more tragic than in Italy. These are drugs that cost few euros but help save so many LIVES. These are the drugs we do to go on holiday in Kenya and prevent malaria to understand each other. This testimony of vasculitis with pulmonary thromboembolism results would be confirmed by the protocols of some other hospitals:\nat the Sacco they damage Clexane to everyone  with predictive D-Dimer: the taller the pcs will answer.\nat St. Gerard of Monza Clexane and cortisone\nat Sant ' Orsola di Bologna Clexane everyone + protocol shared with family doctors prescribing Plaquenil rain on all pcs. monosymptomatic at home. Integrated with an anti-inflammatory statement: Brufen anti-inflammatory drugs  naproxene  aspirin that inhibit cox1 as well as Cox 2 should not be used \nWhile celecoxib (a selective Cox 2 inhibitor) seems to be delivering good results  we still need to wait for studies  instead this analysis shows the need to use in the intermediate stages of the disease (start of cough and before breathing difficulties) one Low molecular weight heparin at high doses... (Clexane 8.000 IU / day). Avoid (so as not to burden the exposure too much  and because the text is too medical) to report an interesting testimony from an anatomy pathologist: just think that Bergamo's \u2032\u2032 Pope John XXIII \u2032\u2032 performed 50 autopsies and the \u2032\u2032 Sacco \u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032 of Milan 20 (the Italian one is the highest case in the world  the Chinese have only done 3 and \u2032\u2032 minimally invasive \u2032\u2032). Everything that comes out seems to fully confirm the above information. In a nutshell  it seems that exitus is determined by a DIC (for non-doctors  Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) triggered by the virus. So interstitial pneumonia had nothing to do with it  it was just a diagnostic mistake: we doubled the places in CPR  with exorbitant costs  probably unnecessarily. In hindsight  I think about all those Rx Torax we commented on about a month ago: those images that were interstitial pneumonia might actually be completely consistent with an INTRAVASCULATED COAGULATION.", "comments": "3", "shares": "33", "reactions": {"all": " 36", "likes": "31", "love": 0, "wow": "5", "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked":

The diseased version of the new coronavirus gene tree in the United States has evolved the longest in the world with 26 mutations When the world is fully fighting the epidemic ... At the same time  there are many voices questioning where the source of the new crown virus is  and there is more and more evidence that Wuhan is not the original source of the virus! This article is transferred from Weibo for everyone's reference (unconfirmed) The number of virus mutations in the gene tree proves that the strain version of the United States has evolved the longest  France is second  and China cannot even enter the top three. Figure 1: A strain of a March 8th case in Washington State  USA  had 26 mutations-(the original website estimated that this problem had been exposed and the problem has been deleted  but fortunately I have screenshots  I ca n\u2019t run  clear Clear)\nFigure 2: France's patient strain had 18 mutations on March 2\nFigure 3: The furthest mutation in China. Hong Kong patients had only 10 mutations on February 26. Conclusion: The more genetic mutations  the longer the virus has existed and evolved. The Washington state of the United States has evolved 2.6 times the longest version of the Chinese mutation. The gene does not lie. The virus originated in the United States. Let's talk about it visually. It is like that the original virus carrier was pangolin. Suppose it transmitted the virus to the citizens of Wuhan. Now all the Chinese cases have less than 10 mutations. Now there are 26 mutations in the virus in an American patient  indicating that pangolin transmitted the virus to Americans 2.6 times earlier than China. If the virus has evolved in Wuhan for 3 months  the virus has evolved in the United States for at least six months. . Therefore  precisely because the virus began to evolve in the United States half a year ago  its early version may be weakly infectious  and the Wuhan version mutated into a severe infectious agent. It now appears that the virus spread in Europe and even South America longer than China. In view of the fact that the data in the United States has been changed  look at the data of the 18 mutations in France collected on March 2 and the data of 10 mutations in Hong Kong collected on February 26  which is 4 days behind. This shows that the French virus has evolved more than 8 mutations.\nWhy is there less foreign data on the roots of gene trees? Because of the late screening of viruses in foreign countries  patients with very early versions of foreign strains have either died or been treated as colds. The Chinese version of the strain has evolved far.", "comments": "35", "shares": "53", "reactions": {"all": " 35", "likes": "25", "love": "1", "wow": "9", "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0},

CDC admitted they screwed up COVID19 infection counts and intentionally misled the public and have apologized  clarifying that the amount of people truly infected is much lower than what was originally reported. An error so egregious it made the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute say \u201chow could the CDC make this mistake? This is a mess.\" The American Coronavirus Task Force also admitted to fudging the National COVID19 death count when Dr. Birx said the deaths are people who died \u201cwith\u201d COVID19 not \u201cfrom\u201d COVID19  thus making the real death count much lower than what is currently being reported. Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted masks won\u2019t help against the virus and mask manufacturers are now including warnings that their products do not deter COVID19. He also said that continuing to close the country could cause irreparable damage. CDC backtracked their initial claim that led governors to shutdown their states & clarified that COVID19 does not spread easily on surfaces. Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo confirmed a recent health study showing that 70% of new infections actually originate at home  thus making stay at home orders one of the most dangerous mandates currently in place. Trump stopped funding the WHO and threatened to cut off money permanently until they can prove they are no longer corruptly influenced by communist China after they lied to our country about human to human transmission of COVID19 in January. The curve is flattened  the CDC  WHO  Dr. Fauci  our governors  and many more were completely wrong about the potential threat of this virus. Even California is opening up sooner than anyone expected because the evidence contradicts the long standing and inaccurate narrative still upheld by the extremely dishonest & corrupt media. If you are still living in fear. Don\u2019t be. The media  global organizations  the government  and its agencies \u201cmislead\u201d the public. People called those of us who knew this all along conspiracy theorists  but it turns out we were just following the facts! Open up your businesses  churches  and homes. Don\u2019t fall for the lies any longer. If you fell for the lies this time  wake up and join the army of truth seekers fighting on the front lines. The #CDC just confirmed a .2% death-rate for #COVID19 For that  we have: * Added nearly 6 trillion to national debt * Laid-off or furloughed 50 million workers * Placed 60 million on food stamps * Gone from 3.5%to 14.7% unemployment * Crippled the petroleum industry * Ruined the tourism industry * Bankrupted the service industry * destroyed food industries and supply chains * Threatened  fined

If you look at WHO's statistics for influenza flu  this is what stands out: in recent years there has been a regular peak over fall and winter. In the summer  a weak flu occurrence could also be proven  which then rose significantly again in the autumn. However  the year 2020 is completely different. Since April  influenza virus has miraculously disappeared from the face of the earth. Possible explanation: Influenza sufferers have received new label and are all running under COVID-19. Something incomprehensible at the sight of this curve is called for flu vaccination. Against a disease that apparently doesn't exist anymore. Among us pastor sons and daughters: of course influenza flu continues to exist. Currently  however  only SARS-CoV-2 is in our consciousness. Time to develop a more relaxed relationship with this virus. Corona infections have been around for a long time  like influenza. Both will never go away. If you are allowed to believe the flurfunk in the Bundestag  the next lockdown for January 2021 is already planned. Another 2 weeks in February. If you put just a fraction of the money you are now pumping into the dying economy for the training and good pay of hospital workers and beds  the shortages that are recurring every year would not be an issue. Let's think of the renowned Prof. John Ioannidis  whose studies classify influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in roughly the same danger. Shouldn't we learn from him slowly?
