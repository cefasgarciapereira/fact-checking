El remedio herbal llamado COVID-19 Organics hecho de Artemisia puede curar a los pacientes con COVID-19 dentro de diez d\u00edas  dijo el presidente. Tambi\u00e9n plante\u00f3 la pregunta de que si fuera un pa\u00eds europeo que realmente hubiera descubierto este remedio  \u00bfhabr\u00eda tanta duda?\n\nEl presidente de Madagascar  Andry Rajoelina  acus\u00f3 a la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud de un complot para tener sus COVID-19 Organics  la \u2018cura\u2019 local africana para el virus envenenado. Rajoelina afirma que la OMS ofreci\u00f3 un soborno de $ 20 millones para envenenar sus medicamentos  inform\u00f3 Tanzania Perspective en la portada de su edici\u00f3n del 14 de mayo.\nEl presidente de Madagascar cree que la \u00fanica raz\u00f3n por la que el resto del mundo se ha negado a tratar la cura de Madagascar para el coronavirus con urgencia y respeto es que el remedio proviene de \u00c1frica.\n\nEn una entrevista con los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n franceses  el presidente Rajoelina dijo haber notado lo que cree que proviene de la condescendencia habitual hacia los africanos. Necesitamos su apoyo para continuar con nuestro periodismo independiente y de investigaci\u00f3n basado en la investigaci\u00f3n sobre las amenazas externas e internas que enfrenta la India.

No lo creo \u201d  dijo el jefe de estado m\u00e1s joven de \u00c1frica  el presidente de Madagascar  Andry Rajoelina.\nEl remedio  COVID Organics  est\u00e1 hecho de Artemisia  una planta importada a Madagascar en la d\u00e9cada de 1970 desde China para tratar la malaria. La artemisia ha tenido un \u00e9xito comprobado contra la malaria y  seg\u00fan el presidente Rajoelina  puede curar a los pacientes con COVID-19 en diez d\u00edas.\nSin embargo  la OMS ha criticado tales medidas terap\u00e9uticas naturales contra el coronavirus como la fe ciega.\n\nEn respuesta al escepticismo con el que la OMS est\u00e1 tratando a los COVID Organics  Rajoelina dijo: \u00abNing\u00fan pa\u00eds u organizaci\u00f3n nos impedir\u00e1 seguir adelante\u00bb.\nUna gran cantidad de otros pa\u00edses africanos  incluidos Tanzania  Guinea-Bissau  Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica del Congo y N\u00edger  han importado la receta hecha en Madagascar.\n\nMIENTRAS TANTO  en otra naci\u00f3n africana  Nigeria  Bill Gates ha sido sorprendido sobornando al programa forzado de Coronavirus . Basado en un informe de inteligencia humana interceptado  estall\u00f3 una controversia en Nigeria por la cual se revela que Bill Gates ofreci\u00f3 un soborno de $ 10 millones para un programa de vacunaci\u00f3n forzada para el Coronavirus a la C\u00e1mara de Representantes de Nigeria.\n\nLos partidos pol\u00edticos de la oposici\u00f3n rechazaron el \u00abProyecto de ley patrocinado por el extranjero\u00bb que ordena la vacunaci\u00f3n obligatoria de todos los nigerianos  incluso cuando no se han descubierto las vacunas  y exigieron que se destituya al Presidente si fuerza el proyecto de ley sobre los miembros.\n\nSolo un par de d\u00edas despu\u00e9s  un pol\u00edtico italiano EXIGI\u00d3 el ARRESTO de BILL GATES el parlamento italiano. Sara Cunial  miembro del Parlamento de Roma  denunci\u00f3 a Bill Gates como un \u00abcriminal de la vacuna\u00bb e inst\u00f3 al presidente italiano a entregarlo a la Corte Penal Internacional por cr\u00edmenes contra la humanidad.\nTambi\u00e9n expuso la agenda de Bill Gates en la India y \u00c1frica  junto con los planes para #controlar la #raza #humana a trav\u00e9s del programa de identificaci\u00f3n digital ID2020.\n\nLa controversia de Madagascar ha estallado d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de que Tanzania expulsara a la OMS despu\u00e9s de que las muestras de Cabra y Papaya vinieran COVID-19 Positivo.

Are the infrared thermometers we're using to measure the temperature dangerous for vision? The answer is NO. The thermometers we're exposed to in different locations function as a sensor reading the infrared wave that we naturally emit all humans. The thermometer uses a light  not a laser  which points the direction of the sensor where the temperature will be measured. These thermometers are passive and acquire a measure without emitting any type of laser or dangerous wave to the eyes or other part of the body. These infrared thermometers have been common in many homes for a long time and their safety is widely known. We urge you to use trusted sources to clear doubts and to follow our page for any eye health information.

consultant 0000 Peace be upon you  God's mercy and blessings\nSince it is firm that experience is the best proof.\nActual experience has shown that eating a raw  raw  small onion that is not cooked  cut off twice a day  is completely enough without further measures to prevent respiratory virus infection (novel coronavirus covid19 and influenza) no matter how severe the exposure is For them.\nI've posted to people since mid-February and I'm still posting and following those committed to this  I haven't found a single infection with Covid-19 or the flu despite some of them being mixed with confirmed Covid-19 symptoms and medical tests (PCR) to date 4 June 2020  this despite their different age and suffering from diseases such as high blood sugar and high pressure.\nAmong those I follow are six private medical centers that receive patients every day  as well as a large industrial company  except for a lot of families growing day by day.\nI also follow the residents of Egypt's operating area to fly in Maza and their neighbors from the residents of the city of Officers and buildings of the Saudi Egyptian Company  and I also treat the injured and always those who did not commit to eating onions. Onion prevents Covid-19 just as it helps in speed recovery  also prevents flu infection and flu virus because it has unique properties: Antivirus  anticoagulant  anticytokine  RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme inhepeter  increase intracellular zinc It has a beneficial antibody modulating effect on the immune response towards viruses and bacteria  it has also deferent vitamins and minerals. Previously published on May 23: Can corona virus get rid of in Egypt like China got rid of it?\nYes it can in just three weeks from now if we spread it and commit to it all  this is about an actual reality that many people have committed to after knowing it since mid February and I have been before them  its results have been followed so far and it has been impressive No one has been sick with the Coronavirus or the flu despite some people mixed with Corona confirmed with symptoms and tests (PCR).\nNote that six of those I follow are from private medical centers and now one of the large industrial companies. Required:\nCommitment to eating a small onion besides any two meals a day  with fresh raw uncooked cut off when eating  totally enough to prevent respiratory virus infection (Coronavirus and influenza) no matter the severity of their exposure. Whoever adhere to this will be safe from getting infected with the Corona virus completely in this world  and whoever spreads it to let people know and abide by it will be rewarded with Allah in the Hereafter as much as his intention and quest  so whoever revives a soul He is in the sight of God as if he revived all people.\nMay Allah keep everyone safe and sound.\nI advise besides what I mentioned not to violate the Ministry of Health instructions. (Finished) I have treated a number of Covit patients 19 hosts to their appropriate protocol  eating onions twice a day  and in cases of difficulty breathing onions for ten minutes from a bag of onions placed after cutting too small pieces or running away His exhale and exhale forcefully out of the mouth outside the cyst  and it was an improvement in breathing and accompanying chest pains was immediate thanks to God. The days continue to prove and confirm the truth of what I said and the possibility of ending this epidemic in at least three weeks  but it will only be done with your help and everyone:\nFirst: We each commit to eating a small lemon-sized onion twice a day to protect ourselves and his family.\nSecondly  I share this message as much as you can  so it may reach those who have the command  so they take it  so it may reach: - Dr. Minister of Health / Hala Zayed Professor Dr. Advisor to the President of the Republic instead of Taj Al-Din Or maybe it reaches the President of the Republic / Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi I am waiting for fellow doctors  the first of whom is the captain of doctors  Dr. Hussein Khairy  to cooperate with me in achieving this goal for the benefit of our people in Egypt for the sake of Allah  and enough for those who have been injured so far and those who have died.

I'm bringing back the mess. Sent in ' our medical chat from colleagues in Brescia..... our Pathological Anatomy service started performing autopsies on COVID1 9-positive patients  after some initial remora as their international scientific society ranked COVID-19 among the pathogens belonging to hazard group 3 (like anthrax  prions  some mycobacteria... I mean  Ebola belongs to HG 4  which is the maximum level of dangerousness). To date they have completed about 50 autopsies  in almost all cases targeted at the lungs. They're waiting for a special suit so they can safely perform autopsy exam on the brain.\nOurs is the largest case in the world  as the Chinese have published only the results of 3 \u2032\u2032 minimally invasive \u2032\u2032 autopsies (+ another block case report) and since the only other Italian hospital performing autopsies is the Sacco (with reports about 20 cases).\nI'm bringing back to you what I've carpentered about the anatomo-pathological dissertation (presented by Gianatti and Sonzogni) and the most significant interventions of some of the present.\nAlready macroscopically the lungs appear \u2032\u2032 spotty \"  with hyperemic / hemorrhagic areas alternating with rosy areas. Histologically  some areas are severely emphysematous  with massively dilated blood vessels (up to 20 times the norm) often replete microthrombes. In many cases widespread alveolar damage (DAD) is evident  with pneumocytes desquamation  hyaline membranes and a fibrotic exudate (as in ARDS). It looks like high-reach syndrome  with hepatomegaly and portals dilated with thrombosis spread across all levels. Even the heart appears magnified  it always presents hydropercycardium and marked ventricular hypertrophy sx (but they are almost always hypertensive patients in a history). In one case they observed a thrombus almost completely obstructing the superior vena cava and the atrium dx. They often noticed the rise of the diaphragm  indicating that at some point the lungs are no longer expanding  associated with hepatomegaly. Sex  pending data on samples from SNC  requested to be able to biopsy the olfactory mucosa; COVID-19 classically gives anosmia and ageusia: it could reach the brain stem trans-synaptic starting from the peripheral nerve terminations olfactory or lingual (as well as the innervation of the lungs). In this scenario  part of respiratory failure could be caused by direct damage of the virus on the brain stump nucleus (ambiguous core  lonely tract...). From the point of view of immune system cells  many macrophages but very few lymphocytes are interstituted. Rambaldi stresses that in the blood of patients with COVID-19 infection there are a very large number of endothelial cells (expression of endothelial damage directly caused by the virus) and that these cells trigger a cytokine storm that especially recruits macrophages. This is also why high dose cortisone could work. An anti-complement drug (narsoplimab  the study is closed) has been used in 6 patients that dramatically reduced the number of circulating plasma endothelial cells (but clinical end-points were not specified).\nBottom line: Anatomo-pathologists tell us to freely ask for autopsies that we think are appropriate (especially sudden deaths  or deaths in relatively young and otherwise healthy patients)  accompanied by as much information as possible (comorbidity  date of onset of symptoms  therapies done  O2 support system  IT passage). This is to understand how much \u2032\u2032 progress \u2032\u2032 there is in the disastrous lungs that they have examined and to explain some abnormal finds (e.g. a case of amyloidosis or an abnormal thickening of the myocardial that according to Senni cannot be traced to acute myocarditis...) ..

The eponymous film with Johnny Depp starring later appeared.\nThe modern elixir of youth is called ADRENOCHROME. This is the seized blood of children with the highest concentration of adrenaline. Blood is extracted from the child's pineal gland at the moment of fear and horror when the adrenaline levels are off the charts. The blood of adults is unfit because with age the pineal iron does not grow and the production of adrenaline falls. As a result of injury  children experience higher adrenaline tides.\n\u2032\u2032 Pedophiles are called ADRENOCHROME \u2032\u2032 Walnut Sauce \"  as the pineal gland resembles walnut or cone. The term was discovered during a 2016 Hillary Clinton correspondence with John Podesta.\n\u2032\u2032 Walnut sauce \u2032\u2032 sounds very innocent  but it's the code satanic vampires use. This is their secret cannibalistic recipe that can't be implemented without sexual abuse  child injuries  tortures over them and their subsequent murder. At the end of torture  they cut out the pineal gland and extract blood. This is a diabolical drink that helps them not to age and get high.\nMal Gibson has repeatedly said that newborn babies are currency in Hollywood's satanic pedophile society.", "comments": "53",

According to valuable information from Italian pathologists  ventilators and intensive care units were never needed. Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics  antivirals  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases  that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected. However  protocols are currently being changed in Italy who have been adversely affected by this pandemic. The impressive case of a Mexican family in the United States who claimed they were cured with a home remedy was documented: three 500 mg aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey  taken hot. The next day they woke up as if nothing had happened to them! Well  the scientific information that follows proves they are right! This information was released by a medical researcher from Italy: \u201cThanks to 50 autopsies performed on patients who died of COVID-19  Italian pathologists have discovered that IT IS NOT PNEUMONIA  strictly speaking  because the virus does not only kill pneumocytes of this type  but uses an inflammatory storm to create an endothelial vascular thrombosis.\u201d In disseminated intravascular coagulation  the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed  but there is also a heart attack  stroke and many other thromboembolic diseases. In fact  the protocols left antiviral therapies useless and focused on anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting therapies. These therapies should be done immediately  even at home  in which the treatment of patients responds very well. If the Chinese had denounced it  they would have invested in home therapy  not intensive care! So  the way to fight it is with antibiotics  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan  20  that is  the Italian series is the highest in the world  the Chinese did only 3  which seems to fully confirm the information. In a nutshell  the disease is determined by a disseminated intravascular coagulation triggered by the virus; therefore  it is not pneumonia but pulmonary thrombosis  a major diagnostic error. Some world leaders doubled the number of resuscitation places in the ICU  with unnecessary exorbitant costs. According to the Italian pathologist  treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. \u201cIf we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate  it is useless  in fact  nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular  not respiratory.\u201d \u201cIt is venous microthrombosis  not pneumonia  that determines mortality.\u201d According to the literature  inflammation induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanism. Unfortunately  what the scientific literature said  especially Chinese  until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used. Now  the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics  as in influenza  and the number of hospitalized patients has been reduced. He also discovered that many deaths  even in their 40s  had a history of fever for 10 to 15 days  which were not treated properly. The inflammation does a great deal of tissue damage and creates ground for thrombus formation. However  the main problem is not the virus  but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed. In fact  patients with rheumatoid arthritis have never needed to be admitted to the ICU because they are on corticosteroid therapy  which is a great anti-inflammatory. With this important discovery  it is possible to return to normal life and open closed deals due to the quarantine  though not immediately  but with time. Kindly share so that the health authorities of each country can make their respective analysis of this information  prevent further deaths and redirect investments appropriately; the vaccine may come later. *linkedin source", "comments": "3", "shares": "19493", "reactions": {"all": 2500, "likes": 19000, "love": "110", "wow": "373", "haha": "55", "sad": "6", "angry": "36", "care": "18"},

from no less than 45 people. You MUST watch this 26 minute documentary.\nAnd we'll also get it texted in Danish quite quickly. Here Judy Mikovitz talks about how among others. Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert Gallo stole her work and ignored the HIV / AIDS warnings for months so that the virus could spread and money could be made from medicine. Fauci got Mikovits arrested  got her home searched without court order. Subsequently forced her to silence for 5 years. Same Fauci was banned from Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of resume. Doctors stand to lose their jobs if they use this effective and cheap drug to cure patients. We see the same thing at home where the authorities and the media are so damn busy telling the people that you can do NOTHING but waiting for Bill Gates vaccine. Here is the movie that reveals the whole plot in 26 minutes.\nOnce you've seen it you know how much Judy Mikovitz risks but also why NOBODY can sit this knowledge overheard anymore. EVERYONE who knows how corrupt this industry is and how many crimes it commits and how many lives it has on conscience are obligated to future generations to say massively and claim their knowledge. This is deadly serious. The people who propagandize this pandemic worldwide are one of the most criminals there is. They need to be stopped and if you have just a tiny opportunity to make the slightest difference to stop these psychopaths  you do it NOW.

I spent my childhood pulling apart electronics and big parts like 21 pin SCART ports are easy to recognise. He also shows the set-top box casing sitting on his car in the video!

Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook  I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all  I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark  he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well  you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases  people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally  you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah  you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark  they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now  the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease  if they had mild symptoms  we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes  they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1 765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact  you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH  that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble  your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home  don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case  they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES  ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally  people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30  he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people  their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34  he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES  but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes  they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda  USC  UCLA  Stanford  U of Washington  etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes  but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately  this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes  they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes  they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat  the clothes you wear  the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them.

We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah  you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark  they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now  the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease  if they had mild symptoms  we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes  they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1 765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact  you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH  that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble  your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home  don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case  they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES  ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally  people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30  he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people  their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34  he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES  but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes  they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda  USC  UCLA  Stanford  U of Washington  etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes  but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately  this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes  they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes  they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat  the clothes you wear  the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them. That's not true either.", "comments": "0", "shares": "2547", "reactions": {"all": " 945", "likes": "771", "love": "130", "wow": "34", "haha": "4", "sad": 0, "angry": "5", "care": "1"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 3736, "checked_link": "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/22/facebook-posts/no-california-gov-gavin-newsom-hasnt-been-vacation/", "countries": "UnitedStates", "date": "2020-05-18", "justify": "explanation newsom has not been vacationing in stevensville in recent weeks  his office said the montana governors office and stevensville mayor said the same thing", "label": "FALSE", "source": " PolitiFact", "title": " while california is dying  gavin newsom is vacationing in stevensville mt", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=while-california-is-dying-gavin-newsom-is-vacationing-in-stevensville-mt", "facebook_id": "595805844382034", "author": "Frontline America with Ben Bergquam", "facebook_date": "May 18  2020 at 2:17 AM", "content": "While California is dying  not because of COVID  but because of the Newsom/Democrat lockdown  I hear Gavin is vacationing in Stevensville  MT!
