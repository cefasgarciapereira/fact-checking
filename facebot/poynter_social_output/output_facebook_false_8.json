Please read and execute it with your contacts. Thank you -----------\nThe novel NCP coronavirus * may not show signs of infection for several days *  before which you can't tell if a person is infected. But by the time you have a fever and / or cough and go to the hospital  your lungs are already 50 % fibrosis and it's too late!\nTaiwanese experts suggest we do a simple check that we can do ourselves every morning:\nTake a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you manage to do it without coughing  discomfort  feeling oppressed  etc.  it shows no lung fibrosis  basically indicating no infection. In these critical times  do this check every morning in a clean air environment!\nThese are serious and great advice from Chinese doctors who have dealt with COVID-19. cases. Everyone needs to make sure their mouth and throat are wet  never DRY. Drink a few sips of water at least every 15 minutes. WHY? Even if the virus penetrates your mouth... water or other fluids will sweep it through the esophagus and stomach. Once in the stomach... stomach acid will kill the virus right away. If you don't drink enough water more regularly... the virus can penetrate your airway and lungs. This is very dangerous.

Pan-African newspaper which promotes African values  has never published such a story in any of its print and digital editions as well as on its website or digital platforms at any time. Someone is obviously abusing our name to malign fellow Africans and in the process tarnishing our image.\nWe are an authentic publication which seeks to tell the African story from an African perspective and unity among Africans is one of our top priorities. We are guided by objectivity in our reportage and strong journalistic values and ethics. There is no way our publication will carry stories which seek to malign anyone  moreso nationals from other African countries  or anywhere for that matter.\nWe believe that it is only through unity of purpose and concerted efforts by everyone that the war against Covid-19 can be won on the African continent and in the world.

The National Health Service (UK) yesterday released a statement indicating that this information is inaccurate and advising patients to continue managing their condition as usual. They have stipulated that  while \"rescue packs\" for people with illnesses such as asthma or COPD do exist  they have little to do with coronavirus. Similarly  in Ireland  \u201crescue packs\u201d  which contain antibiotic and steroidal medication  do exist in a very limited setting. They are in very rare circumstances provided to patients who work very closely with their GP as part of a closely monitored self-management plan. They are typically provided to patients with the severest form of asthma or COPD  specifically suitable for patients who are very well versed in managing and understanding their symptoms due to the severity of their condition. In these circumstances  rescue packs are given with clear and specific instruction and are meant to be used only where symptoms are considerably exacerbated and the patient does not have immediate access to their GP. Upon using a \u201crescue pack\u201d  the patient is obliged to contact their GP within 24 hours and seek further medical advice  and treatment where needed. Misuse or overuse of the medication in \u201crescue packs\u201d can have a variety of unintended consequences and can involve risks of a serious nature. These include masking symptoms during medical assessment  being considered an appropriate treatment by the patient where emergency response is actually needed  used inappropriately (for example  where the issue is infection rather than exacerbation of existing condition and risk of resistance bugs). \u201cRescue packs\u201d are not for widespread use by asthma or COPD patients and are not recommended as part of a national healthcare response to coronavirus. Asthma and COPD patients in Ireland should continue to manage their condition as advised by their GP  as reaffirmed in relevant communications made by the HSE in recent weeks.", "comments": "20",

get to see and live what is happening here in our hospital for three weeks. The nightmare is flowing  the river is getting bigger and more unstable; A few came at first  then tens then hundreds and now we are no longer doctors  but we have become sorters in the lane and decide who lives and who should be sent home to die  Although all these people paid taxes to Italy all their lives;\nUntil two weeks ago  my colleagues and I were atheists; it was normal because we are medicinists and we learned science and science was told that it excluded the presence of God; I always laughed at my parents who went to church.\n9 days ago  a 75-year-old pastor came to us; gentle man  he had big respiratory problems  but he had a Bible and impressed us that he was reading to the dying and they were holding his hand; being all new tired doctors  discouraged  mentally and physically finished  when we had time we were sitting to listen to it; now we have to admit: we as humans have reached our limits; we cannot do more  and more people die daily; and we are Exhausted  we already have two colleagues who have died and others can barely stand on their feet; We realized that where the man can end  we need God and we started praying when we have a few minutes left; we talk to each other and We cannot believe that from fierce atheists we arrived daily to find peace asking God to help us resist so we can take care of the sick.\nYesterday the pastor of 75 years died; that never until today  even though we had over 120 dead in 3 weeks here  we were all finished  destroyed because the old pastor succeeded while staying at our place bring a peace we no longer hope to find. The pastor went to the Lord and we will soon follow. I haven't been home for 6 days  I don't know when I ate the last time  and I realize my uselessness on this earth and I want to dedicate my last breath to helping others.

Please be advised that this message is FAKE  and has not been issued by UNHCR. This message creates unnecessary fear and distrust towards refugees  and it contributes to pushing refugees even further into the margins causing distress in the communities and preventing them from seeking help when they need it. It is important that we all act responsibly and in solidarity with those who are in a weaker position than us no matter the reason in this challenging situation. For the last few weeks  UNHCR has been coordinating closely with the Ministry of Health in order to ensure that refugee communities are included in the Government\u2019s national response measures and to support the Government\u2019s response. Here are some key measures we have taken: \u2022 Making sure that updated information is distributed to refugees quickly in languages they understand. This includes informing refugees that  if they have symptoms  they can get tested and treated for free like everyone else.\n\u2022 We have also set up an information portal called refugee-malaysia.org where all refugees and organisations supporting refugees can get information on where to find help and services for refugees. This includes the COVID-19 restriction of movement order issued by the Government.\n\u2022 There are also Hotlines in several languages for refugees who may not be able to access the national crisis Hotlines. We will also make available UNHCR interpreters to provide translation services at public hospitals for refugees.\n\u2022 UNHCR is also prepared to assist the Government with contact tracing efforts in cases involving refugees.\n\u2022 Most importantly  all our essential protection  health and assistance services will continue for refugees during the movement control order. If you work with refugees and have questions to ask about services  visit www.refugee-malaysia.org to get information and Hotline numbers.", "comments": "30", "shares": "156", "reactions": {"all": " 214", "likes": "208", "love": "3", "wow": "1", "haha": "1", "sad": "1", "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},]
