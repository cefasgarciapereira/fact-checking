Middle roots are also closed..! Many villages in Kandy sealed..! 300 suspected deaths and 500 were burnt in bodybags..! (Sri Lanka e News-2020. May. 02  a. m. 7.40) Even though the government tried to shut down  the corona epidemic is spreading severely across Sri Lanka. Providing the best evidence for that  the Madamulana area of Weeraketiya  which was the village of Rajapakshala  has been completely closed today. The reason for this is that 9 corona infected people were found in that area. In addition to the south's Medamulana  Walasmulla  four-road areas have also been closed. 2 corona infected people have been found in the four road area. The most reason for the closure of the above areas is that the found infected were walking around the village. In addition  Central Province is the most endangered by now. A large number of infections have been found in the Kandy district of Central Province and many villages have been completely closed last night as they have also walked in many places. They are  in the area of Pathahewa sixty\nPuliyedda  Nahinawala  Nahinawala North  Katawala  Thalathuoya  Dambawela North  Bawulana  Kandakula  Villages  In Kandy district \nPoojapitiya  Bokkawela  Ambakka  Hirassagala  Ampitiya  Nugawela  Gampola  Nawalapitiya road junction  Akurana  Wattagedara  Madawala (3 infected found)  Ukgahakumbura  Valdeniya  Moragaha hill  Gamhatha  Siyabalapitiya  Pussadeniya  Four Liyadda Pradda The area is the one who is the one who is 117 people from the previous Thalathuoya area have been taken to Punani camp for quarantine and 19 of them have been confirmed corona positive. As there have been a number of infected people from the above areas  the decision has been made to close these areas according to the recommendations made by the public health officials to the police to close these areas. Suspected deaths 500-JJ. Ni. Inspector of Police / Death 300-Zonal Medical Director\n-------------------------------\nMeanwhile  unofficial reports say that the death toll which was suspected to be Corona and performed as per the Corona asset is much higher than the government says. A senior deputy inspector who couldn't disclose the name he commented on Lanka e News said that  according to his knowledge  more than 500 such deaths have occurred across the country. Meanwhile  Hambantota Zonal Director Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa  is noting on a social network that more than 300 suspected corona deaths have occurred islandwide. Chamal Sanjeewa doctor  who also claims that all the dead bodies were cremated using safe container bags  says he is revealing the truth as per a request made by Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake  the director in charge of the Central Pharmaceutical Store. The stupid government should understand that lies are not a vaccine for any virus. People should be wise not to accept the lies of the government and risk their lives by considering the epidemic as small as possible. - By a staff reporter of Sri Lanka e News -", "comments": "0", "shares": "29", "reactions": {"all": " 56", "likes": "44", "love": "1", "wow": "1", "haha": 0, "sad": "10", "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 10559, "checked_link": "https://faktograf.hr/2020/03/26/koronavirus-cijepljene-gripa-istrazivanja/", "countries": "Croatia", "date": "2020-03-26", "justify": "explanation there is no evidence that a flu vaccine makes things worse for covid19 patients", "label": "Misleading", "source": " Faktograf", "title": " people who got a flu shot are at a greater risk from covid19", "poynter_link": "https://www.poynter.org/?ifcn_misinformation=people-who-got-a-flu-shot-are-at-a-greater-risk-from-covid-19", "facebook_id": "2359928954108778", "author": "Vigor Colnar II", "facebook_date": "Mar 23  2020", "content": "\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc24\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc29\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2f \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc2e \"\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc1a\" \ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc22 \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22  \ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc01\ud835\udc02 \ud835\udc22\ud835\udc33\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc09\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc15\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27-\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26  \ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc23\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc24 \ud835\udc20\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc33\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc2e\n\nBritanski dnevni list \"Mirror\" prenosi slijede\u0107u izjavu visokog dr\u017eavnog predstavnika medicinske vlasti. \"Vijest dolazi dok javnost zahtijeva od vlade vi\u0161e odgovora oko toga tko spada u tu kategoriju  s obzirom na uobi\u010dajene zdravstvene probleme.\n\nJonathan Van-Tam  zamjenik glavnog medicinskog ureda za Englesku  rekao je jutros za BBC: \"Ne \u017eelim ulaziti u ogromne detalje oko svake pojedina\u010dne rizi\u010dne skupine  ali tvrdimo da su ljudi koji se cjepe protiv gripe  osim djece uklapaju u visoku kategoriju rizika  ljudi za koje se savjetuje vrlo sna\u017ena socijalna distanca. \" [1][2]\n\nDa cjepivo protiv gripe pove\u0107ava rizik od zaraze coronavirusom i znanstveno je dokazano.
