Opinion of Scientists:\nquarantine is useless. \u2032\u2032 You can deceive some people all the time  and all the people for a while  but you can't lie all the time.\"-Abraham Lincoln. After 3 months after the announcement of the pandemic  even people far from science begin to understand that the pandemic and quarantine have non-medical goals  Sergey Perelegin said this back in March [11] Today  the words of honest scientists who are being silent are with special power  because they are really inconvenient for the organizers of a disaster called quarantine and the blockage of the economy. \u2022 A study of scientists at Blavatnik University School on Efficiency of quarantine showed that the reduction of virus mortality quarantine was useless  but it was extremely effective for economic destruction. [1] \u2022 Epidemiology professor Sunetra Gupta from Oxford University said: We would have more success in epidemiological protection if we hadn't introduced quarantine [2] \u2022 Doctor of Medicine Nikolai Filatov from the Institute of Vaccines and Serums named after. Mechnikova said that quarantine is a useless measure  and Covid19 is the most common infection. In Moscow  about 3 million people get flu annually  more fatalities than from coronavirus  but we never said that the flu was a disaster and did not lock people up. Natural immunization of the population will pass  and everything will end. [3] \u2022 Camilla Stoltenberg  Director of the Norwegian Health Institute  stated uselessness of quarantine: \u2032\u2032 After examining the actual virus spread statistics before and after the introduction of of quarantine  we concluded that of quarantine could and should have been avoided with more focused measures.\" [4 ] \u2022 Professor Eran Segal from the Weitzman Institute in Israel said the government is misleading people  talking about the advent of a second wave of the virus. This is not the second wave  this is not the end of the first wave that the government artificially stretched with of quarantine [5] \u2022 A study of scientists from the University of East England showed that a tough quarantine introduced in many countries had hardly benefited  but destroyed the economy. Scientists recommend restricting only mass clusters of people and continue to avoid quarantine. [6] https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2020-opinion-coronavirus-europe-lockdown-excess-deaths-recession/ \u2022 A study by scientists from the University College of London found that closing schools for quarantine has hardly affected the rate of virus spread. This measure helped prevent up to 2 % of all deaths. But the expenditures that the state and population of different countries were very significant. The closure of schools has negatively impacted the mental and physical health of children forced to sit in apartments for a day. Family savings have decreased seriously. [7] \u2022 Mathematics professor Itzhak Ben Israel from Tel Aviv University investigated the dynamics of virus spread in the USA  Britain  Sweden  Italy  Israel  Switzerland  France  Germany and Spain. Numbers showed that whether the country was placed in quarantine or lived a normal life  the coronavirus peaked at six weeks and remained silent by eight. Professor concludes: quarantine and blocking the economy is not justified and should be replaced with moderate social distancing. Every year  about 4500 people die from the flu and its complications in Israel  but we never declared quarantine (Certificate: 300 victims of Covid19 in Israel were 2020  28 of them died from Covid19  the rest of them from chronic diseases  having a positive test) [8] \u2022 WHO representative Maria Van Kerkhov said that governments should have limited the isolation of infected people with symptoms. That is  that quarantine  destroyed economy  destroyed families  businesses and lives were all unnecessary. [9] \u2022 WHO praised Sweden  whose population is now more immune than quarantine countries. Countries that have not introduced quarantine (Japan  South Korea  Sweden  Belarus  Turkmenistan) have not experienced negative development of events related to Karatnin. [10] Links: 1.

Basado en un informe de inteligencia humana interceptado  estall\u00f3 una controversia en Nigeria por la cual se revela que Bill Gates ofreci\u00f3 un soborno de $ 10 millones para un programa de vacunaci\u00f3n forzada para el Coronavirus a la C\u00e1mara de Representantes de Nigeria.\n\nLos partidos pol\u00edticos de la oposici\u00f3n rechazaron el \u00abProyecto de ley patrocinado por el extranjero\u00bb que ordena la vacunaci\u00f3n obligatoria de todos los nigerianos  incluso cuando no se han descubierto las vacunas  y exigieron que se destituya al Presidente si fuerza el proyecto de ley sobre los miembros.\n\nSolo un par de d\u00edas despu\u00e9s  un pol\u00edtico italiano EXIGI\u00d3 el ARRESTO de BILL GATES el parlamento italiano. Sara Cunial  miembro del Parlamento de Roma  denunci\u00f3 a Bill Gates como un \u00abcriminal de la vacuna\u00bb e inst\u00f3 al presidente italiano a entregarlo a la Corte Penal Internacional por cr\u00edmenes contra la humanidad.\nTambi\u00e9n expuso la agenda de Bill Gates en la India y \u00c1frica  junto con los planes para #controlar la #raza #humana a trav\u00e9s del programa de identificaci\u00f3n digital ID2020.\n\nLa controversia de Madagascar ha estallado d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de que Tanzania expulsara a la OMS despu\u00e9s de que las muestras de Cabra y Papaya vinieran COVID-19 Positivo. Con el aumento de los casos falsos de coronavirus  el presidente de Tanzania  John Magufuli  cada vez m\u00e1s sospechoso de la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS)  decidi\u00f3 investigar las afirmaciones \u00e9l mismo.\nEnvi\u00f3 a la OMS muestras de una cabra  una papaya y una codorniz para su an\u00e1lisis. Despu\u00e9s de que las 3 muestras dieron positivo a COVID-19  se informa que el presidente de Tanzania ech\u00f3 a la OMS del pa\u00eds.\nSiguiendo el liderazgo de Tanzania  Burundi tambi\u00e9n expuls\u00f3 a todo el equipo de coronavirus de la OMS del pa\u00eds por interferencia en asuntos internos. En una carta dirigida a la sede de la OMS en \u00c1frica  el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores dice que los cuatro funcionarios deben partir antes del viernes.\n\n\u00a1Parece que los d\u00edas de la OMS en \u00c1frica han terminado!\n\nFuente: https://greatgameindia.com/who-offered-20m-bribe-to-poison-covid-19-cure-madagascar-president\nBuena Salud\nSee Translation", "comments": "17", "shares": "168", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "10223780423838761", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2011498625650751", "author": "Sociedad Dominicana de Infectolog\u00eda", "date": "May 13  2020", "content": "Posici\u00f3n de la SDI sobre uso de Ivermectina!

And the oldest in him are not people  but viruses and bacteria. But humanity lives in symbiosis with everything alive  including pathogenic microorganisms  for more than 20 thousand years. I was questioning the so-called pandemic caused by the SOVID19 virus  which  in fact  couldn't kill all people on the planet. I think that everyone has already realized that this virus is not as dangerous as the WHO media terrorists and state media painted us in a number of countries in the world. What happened? Who and why needed this unwarranted panic attack on humanity?\nI will divide into three ingredients of COVID-issues: medical  economic and political.\nThe first one is medical: because it was medicine for their own purposes that was used by terrorists who introduced quarantine regimes in the world. Who are these people and why is medicine used as target N 1 for terror? WHO is completely controlled by Bill Gates  Mark Zuckerberg  the Clinton family  George Soros and K.\nThe purpose of these people is enrichment and world domination. Every person fears and worries about their health  the health of their family and loved ones. And when the first terrible pictures from China appeared in the media  and then from Italy  a mess. Under WHO pressure  quarantine measures were introduced worldwide and declared a \u2032\u2032 pandemic \". I emphasize that there were no sick with signs of infection  the world did not know even what to fight but strict quarantine measures were already being implemented  the borders were closed  Air and railway connection  roadblocks were created  etc. The directions were followed by WHO presidents  and then through the Ministry of Health and cabinets of ministers  were implemented. There were also threats to countries that refused to follow ridiculous directions  example Sweden  Belarus  England.\nThey clearly stated: \u2032\u2032 We hope for our doctors  the development of our medicine and science. We will handle this challenge and handle it  please do not interfere.\" It was a clear position of national MOH and country leaders. But completely different worked those who gave themselves to WHO scammers  followed their directions and became their mouthpiece.\nPictures in the media  radio broadcasts  television  internet and numbers  numbers  numbers.. the world is shocked  people are horrified and disoriented.\nEverything is stopped! The world is like during nuclear bombardments  however  without terrible destruction. Empty streets  yards  squares  nothing works  all lurking in anticipation of the terrible SEA. Closed hospitals  established support centers for the fight against COVID19  are being tested  detected contact and their isolation. But there is no mortality! There is no thing people were most afraid of... Three months of fighting the \u2032\u2032 windmills \u2032\u2032 left standing in the same place. But there are sad things that do not want to voice in the Ministry of Health. Only in Ukraine in the last three months died 123 thousand people (and in the world? ) from cardiovascular disease  oncopathology  tuberculosis  neurological disease  suicides  polytraum  alcoholism  surgical complications  etc. from COVID 19 died up to 800 people and this number is rigged because there were no sections and pathologists - Anatomical Studies. The reason doctors fail to do their job  instructions on the possibility of infecting medical staff who will work with deceased patients. Just absurd! And how to know what a person died from? How to identify coronavirus infection? Only on tests  PRL  IFA research and all? Horrified medical staff issued bodies of the deceased who were diagnosed with COVID  in plastic bags  causing relatives outrage. But such guidance and such instructions. Now regarding the number of patients with super infection and the number of infected. The numbers can be viewed in the data of the Ministry of Health  they are printed daily. As of today  June 13  2020  the following data: 30506 cases of coronavirus infection (is it sick with coronavirus or not? )  PRL and IFA research conducted 479  lethal cases since the beginning of quarantine-800. But has no data about the dead for a day from other diseases and pathologies! Only the coronavirus!\nUkraine is one of the few countries that clearly performs WHO guidance. Do you know why? And therefore  \u2032\u2032 God forbid something not to happen!\". Then I ask  \u2032\u2032 Is medicine science or not?\". If a beloved charlatan and a scam  having an impact on WHO  can introduce a similar regime in any country in the world. If you can so easily \u2032\u2032 bend \u2032\u2032 the executives  spitting on the economic opportunities of the state and most importantly - make medicine not science but a smile!\nWhat about Ukraine? Clear pointers from top to bottom. Prime Minister D. Shmygal through his chief sanitary doctor V. Lyashko is introduced quarantine  although they had no authority to do so and we did not have an epidemiological threshold on respiratory - viral infections in March 2020  there was no epidition  no infection itself. There was a crazy media terror that has continued today  but is already significantly blown away. \u2032\u2032 You will go around the whole world with lies  but you won't return back \"  says folk wisdom. They lied to the fact that they are starting to say that there was no need to ban walks in the squares and parks. Do you need masks? There is no treatment for coronavirus infection  but they will save you from infection with mask  watering sidewalks with a solution of chloride and washing your hands. As if people never wash their hands. Now  after 3 months of the \u2032\u2032 heroic \u2032\u2032 fight against COVID19  and  more precisely  mass lies  you need to get out of this g...  in which you fit. There is a weakening of quarantine measures  but talking about the second wave. Which one? Haven't been the first! Lies and media terror were and everyone should answer for that: from premier to executive and law enforcement officials who exceeded their powers. And about Shmygal and Lyashko as one of the methods of punishment to be sentenced to wearing masks for the rest of their lives  and even better in condoms so that such are no longer born.\nDo you know English writer George Orwell and his work \u2032\u2032 Animal Collegiate \"? Good work  read. And let's not turn world civilization into \u2032\u2032 animal collective farm \"!\nP. P. S I'm asked a question why doctors couldn't oppose the implementation of quarantine. Doctors themselves didn't decide anything  they were just doing their job. Hospitals were closed  they were silent  sent on vacation at their expense  too  were they silent? Why is it? Ordinary human fear because of the opportunity to lose jobs and still - leadership. The leaders of the medical institutions in Ukraine are people who are appointed by the authorities for certain terms. If the authorities want to appoint  if they want to release! That's why the directions are followed accurately and clearly! Those directions given by the authorities!\nAbout the economic ingredient and policies that used coronavirus infection for their own purposes  in the next post.\nStay healthy!", "comments": "0", "shares": "113", "reactions": {"all": " 221", "likes": "178", "love": "17", "wow": "5", "haha": 0, "sad": "17", "angry": 0, "care": "4"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2599899966957341", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2617134201869146", "author": "Andrea Demetrio Karpa", "date": "July 13  2020 at 8:27 AM", "content": "   COVID-19 PANDEMIC WAS NOT AND IS NOT SCIENTIFIED BY EXPERTS NOT IN UKRAINE  NOT IN THE WORLD.

Are the infrared thermometers we're using to measure the temperature dangerous for vision? The answer is NO. The thermometers we're exposed to in different locations function as a sensor reading the infrared wave that we naturally emit all humans. The thermometer uses a light  not a laser  which points the direction of the sensor where the temperature will be measured. These thermometers are passive and acquire a measure without emitting any type of laser or dangerous wave to the eyes or other part of the body. These infrared thermometers have been common in many homes for a long time and their safety is widely known. We urge you to use trusted sources to clear doubts and to follow our page for any eye health information.

CDC admitted they screwed up COVID19 infection counts and intentionally misled the public and have apologized  clarifying that the amount of people truly infected is much lower than what was originally reported. An error so egregious it made the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute say \u201chow could the CDC make this mistake? This is a mess.\" The American Coronavirus Task Force also admitted to fudging the National COVID19 death count when Dr. Birx said the deaths are people who died \u201cwith\u201d COVID19 not \u201cfrom\u201d COVID19  thus making the real death count much lower than what is currently being reported. Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted masks won\u2019t help against the virus and mask manufacturers are now including warnings that their products do not deter COVID19. He also said that continuing to close the country could cause irreparable damage. CDC backtracked their initial claim that led governors to shutdown their states & clarified that COVID19 does not spread easily on surfaces. Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo confirmed a recent health study showing that 70% of new infections actually originate at home  thus making stay at home orders one of the most dangerous mandates currently in place. Trump stopped funding the WHO and threatened to cut off money permanently until they can prove they are no longer corruptly influenced by communist China after they lied to our country about human to human transmission of COVID19 in January. The curve is flattened  the CDC  WHO  Dr. Fauci  our governors  and many more were completely wrong about the potential threat of this virus. Even California is opening up sooner than anyone expected because the evidence contradicts the long standing and inaccurate narrative still upheld by the extremely dishonest & corrupt media. If you are still living in fear. Don\u2019t be. The media  global organizations  the government  and its agencies \u201cmislead\u201d the public. People called those of us who knew this all along conspiracy theorists  but it turns out we were just following the facts! Open up your businesses  churches  and homes. Don\u2019t fall for the lies any longer. If you fell for the lies this time  wake up and join the army of truth seekers fighting on the front lines.

Onion prevents Covid-19 just as it helps in speed recovery  also prevents flu infection and flu virus because it has unique properties: Antivirus  anticoagulant  anticytokine  RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme inhepeter  increase intracellular zinc It has a beneficial antibody modulating effect on the immune response towards viruses and bacteria  it has also deferent vitamins and minerals. Previously published on May 23: Can corona virus get rid of in Egypt like China got rid of it?\nYes it can in just three weeks from now if we spread it and commit to it all  this is about an actual reality that many people have committed to after knowing it since mid February and I have been before them  its results have been followed so far and it has been impressive No one has been sick with the Coronavirus or the flu despite some people mixed with Corona confirmed with symptoms and tests (PCR).\nNote that six of those I follow are from private medical centers and now one of the large industrial companies. Required:\nCommitment to eating a small onion besides any two meals a day  with fresh raw uncooked cut off when eating  totally enough to prevent respiratory virus infection (Coronavirus and influenza) no matter the severity of their exposure. Whoever adhere to this will be safe from getting infected with the Corona virus completely in this world  and whoever spreads it to let people know and abide by it will be rewarded with Allah in the Hereafter as much as his intention and quest  so whoever revives a soul He is in the sight of God as if he revived all people.\nMay Allah keep everyone safe and sound.\nI advise besides what I mentioned not to violate the Ministry of Health instructions. (Finished) I have treated a number of Covit patients 19 hosts to their appropriate protocol  eating onions twice a day  and in cases of difficulty breathing onions for ten minutes from a bag of onions placed after cutting too small pieces or running away His exhale and exhale forcefully out of the mouth outside the cyst  and it was an improvement in breathing and accompanying chest pains was immediate thanks to God. The days continue to prove and confirm the truth of what I said and the possibility of ending this epidemic in at least three weeks  but it will only be done with your help and everyone:\nFirst: We each commit to eating a small lemon-sized onion twice a day to protect ourselves and his family.\nSecondly  I share this message as much as you can  so it may reach those who have the command  so they take it  so it may reach: - Dr. Minister of Health / Hala Zayed Professor Dr. Advisor to the President of the Republic instead of Taj Al-Din Or maybe it reaches the President of the Republic / Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi I am waiting for fellow doctors  the first of whom is the captain of doctors  Dr. Hussein Khairy  to cooperate with me in achieving this goal for the benefit of our people in Egypt for the sake of Allah  and enough for those who have been injured so far and those who have died.

I'm bringing back the mess. Sent in ' our medical chat from colleagues in Brescia..... our Pathological Anatomy service started performing autopsies on COVID1 9-positive patients  after some initial remora as their international scientific society ranked COVID-19 among the pathogens belonging to hazard group 3 (like anthrax  prions  some mycobacteria... I mean  Ebola belongs to HG 4  which is the maximum level of dangerousness). To date they have completed about 50 autopsies  in almost all cases targeted at the lungs. They're waiting for a special suit so they can safely perform autopsy exam on the brain.\nOurs is the largest case in the world  as the Chinese have published only the results of 3 \u2032\u2032 minimally invasive \u2032\u2032 autopsies (+ another block case report) and since the only other Italian hospital performing autopsies is the Sacco (with reports about 20 cases).\nI'm bringing back to you what I've carpentered about the anatomo-pathological dissertation (presented by Gianatti and Sonzogni) and the most significant interventions of some of the present.\nAlready macroscopically the lungs appear \u2032\u2032 spotty \"  with hyperemic / hemorrhagic areas alternating with rosy areas. Histologically  some areas are severely emphysematous  with massively dilated blood vessels (up to 20 times the norm) often replete microthrombes. In many cases widespread alveolar damage (DAD) is evident  with pneumocytes desquamation  hyaline membranes and a fibrotic exudate (as in ARDS). It looks like high-reach syndrome  with hepatomegaly and portals dilated with thrombosis spread across all levels. Even the heart appears magnified  it always presents hydropercycardium and marked ventricular hypertrophy sx (but they are almost always hypertensive patients in a history). In one case they observed a thrombus almost completely obstructing the superior vena cava and the atrium dx. They often noticed the rise of the diaphragm  indicating that at some point the lungs are no longer expanding  associated with hepatomegaly. Sex  pending data on samples from SNC  requested to be able to biopsy the olfactory mucosa; COVID-19 classically gives anosmia and ageusia: it could reach the brain stem trans-synaptic starting from the peripheral nerve terminations olfactory or lingual (as well as the innervation of the lungs). In this scenario  part of respiratory failure could be caused by direct damage of the virus on the brain stump nucleus (ambiguous core  lonely tract...). From the point of view of immune system cells  many macrophages but very few lymphocytes are interstituted. Rambaldi stresses that in the blood of patients with COVID-19 infection there are a very large number of endothelial cells (expression of endothelial damage directly caused by the virus) and that these cells trigger a cytokine storm that especially recruits macrophages. This is also why high dose cortisone could work. An anti-complement drug (narsoplimab  the study is closed) has been used in 6 patients that dramatically reduced the number of circulating plasma endothelial cells (but clinical end-points were not specified).\nBottom line: Anatomo-pathologists tell us to freely ask for autopsies that we think are appropriate (especially sudden deaths  or deaths in relatively young and otherwise healthy patients)  accompanied by as much information as possible (comorbidity  date of onset of symptoms  therapies done  O2 support system  IT passage). This is to understand how much \u2032\u2032 progress \u2032\u2032 there is in the disastrous lungs that they have examined and to explain some abnormal finds (e.g. a case of amyloidosis or an abnormal thickening of the myocardial that according to Senni cannot be traced to acute myocarditis...) ..
