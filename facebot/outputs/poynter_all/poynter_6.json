Middle roots are also closed..! Many villages in Kandy sealed..! 300 suspected deaths and 500 were burnt in bodybags..! (Sri Lanka e News-2020. May. 02  a. m. 7.40) Even though the government tried to shut down  the corona epidemic is spreading severely across Sri Lanka. Providing the best evidence for that  the Madamulana area of Weeraketiya  which was the village of Rajapakshala  has been completely closed today. The reason for this is that 9 corona infected people were found in that area. In addition to the south's Medamulana  Walasmulla  four-road areas have also been closed. 2 corona infected people have been found in the four road area. The most reason for the closure of the above areas is that the found infected were walking around the village. In addition  Central Province is the most endangered by now. A large number of infections have been found in the Kandy district of Central Province and many villages have been completely closed last night as they have also walked in many places. They are  in the area of Pathahewa sixty\nPuliyedda  Nahinawala  Nahinawala North  Katawala  Thalathuoya  Dambawela North  Bawulana  Kandakula  Villages  In Kandy district \nPoojapitiya  Bokkawela  Ambakka  Hirassagala  Ampitiya  Nugawela  Gampola  Nawalapitiya road junction  Akurana  Wattagedara  Madawala (3 infected found)  Ukgahakumbura  Valdeniya  Moragaha hill  Gamhatha  Siyabalapitiya  Pussadeniya  Four Liyadda Pradda The area is the one who is the one who is 117 people from the previous Thalathuoya area have been taken to Punani camp for quarantine and 19 of them have been confirmed corona positive. As there have been a number of infected people from the above areas  the decision has been made to close these areas according to the recommendations made by the public health officials to the police to close these areas. Suspected deaths 500-JJ. Ni. Inspector of Police / Death 300-Zonal Medical Director\n-------------------------------\nMeanwhile  unofficial reports say that the death toll which was suspected to be Corona and performed as per the Corona asset is much higher than the government says. A senior deputy inspector who couldn't disclose the name he commented on Lanka e News said that  according to his knowledge  more than 500 such deaths have occurred across the country. Meanwhile  Hambantota Zonal Director Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa  is noting on a social network that more than 300 suspected corona deaths have occurred islandwide. Chamal Sanjeewa doctor  who also claims that all the dead bodies were cremated using safe container bags  says he is revealing the truth as per a request made by Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake  the director in charge of the Central Pharmaceutical Store. The stupid government should understand that lies are not a vaccine for any virus. People should be wise not to accept the lies of the government and risk their lives by considering the epidemic as small as possible. - By a staff reporter of Sri Lanka e News -", "comments": "0", "shares": "29", "reactions": {"all": " 57", "likes": "45", "love": "1", "wow": "1", "haha": 0, "sad": "10", "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "118326933163058", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100041787433206", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "241981923730358", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "778639771", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "555905759", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100006444913618", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "691186333", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100000643616135", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 100006848250564.0, "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": 100013091626919.0, "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100033905170843", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10220984344310993", "author": "Grace Elizabeth Joy Anderson", "date": "May 3  2020 at 2:09 PM", "content": "THOUSANDS OF BABIES AND CHILDREN ARE BEING BROUGHT UP OUT OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS IN NEW YORK'S CENTRAL PARK BY MILITARY PERSONAL  DURING THE NIGHT AND PLACED IN TENTS BROUGHT IN BY FRANKLIN GRAHAM'S SAMARITAN'S PURSE!

Before lockdown RSA it was recorded 542 cases  now the number is on 1663 which shows that Lockdown is not helping to reduce the COVID 19 Cases. As a result the government of SOUTH AFRICA is going to add three months of Totally lockdown which will start on 21 June   And president is asking all foreigners to vacate so that the country can left with its only citizens who will be given free food   water   electricity and free rent. The president says that its government cannot manage to provide these Free things to foreigners since the number of foreigners is high compared to other countries. The president is also asking the Presidents from foreign countries to start sending buses and aeroplanes to carry their citizens especially Zimbabwe  Mozambique  Zambia  Democratic republic of Congo  Tanzania Uganda   Botswana  Malawi  Kenya and other countries including China   Japan  India  Somalia and Burund. The RSA government says that many people are not serious with these current lockdown   this reason forces the government to add three more months.

In a media briefing via Zoom  leaders from the different labor groups have laid down the plans for the Labor Day celebration. Present are Elmer Labog  chairperson of Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU); Atty. Sonny Matula  President of NAGKAISA Chair and President of the Federation of Free Workers (FFW); Joanna Bernice Coronacion - SENTRO  Debie Faigmani  President of the Wyeth Workers\u2019 Union; Judy Miranda of NAGKAISA Women and Secretary General of Partido Manggagawa (PM); and Mylene Cabalona  President of the BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN). The demands of workers work around the theme Kalusugan  Kabuhayan  Karapatan  Ipaglaban! (Health  Livelihood  Human Rights). They also highlighted the relevance of Solusyong Medikal  HindiMilitar and Ayudang Sapat Para Sa Lahat  Mass Testing  Hindi Mass Arrest as their major campaign for the Labor Day protests. \u201cWe can\u2019t emphasize enough the urgency of government to provide immediate relief to all workers. From the President\u2019s report on the 5th week of ECQ  only about 300 000 were given financial aid out of 2million displaced workers!\u201d Labog lamented. \u201cThis is the first time in history our Labor Day protest will be like this  we are ready to go online! Despite the ECQ we will make sure Duterte hears our battlecry!\u201d Atty. Matula of FFW said. Atty. Matula also emphasised the need for income guarantee for all workers  as millions do not have income with the prevailing \u2018no work  no pay\u2019 system. Some labor groups among KMU and Nagkaisa are ready to hold noise barrages in their respective homes and localities. \u201cWe urge the government to strengthen CAMP instead of changing to SBWS. In CAMP  there is flexibility on the part of workers. All you need is an ID and payslip to avail of the financial aid  while in SBWS  your employer has to be compliant first with SSS and BIR. It\u2019s very restrictive\u201d Judy Miranda of Nagkaisa Women added. On the part of the BPO workers  they noted that several companies have violated ECQ guidelines and does not have enough health safety protocols in ensuring physical distancing is observed. BIEN Philippines has recorded several BPO workers being infected by COVID19 and no mass testing has been conducted to workers. In one company Cebu City  three BPO workers were positive of COVID while present at work and no immediate action were given by the company. \u201cThis is a manifestation that our efforts to keep the economy alive means nothing to this government. We are neglected and DOLE has admitted they are not aware of the working conditions of BPO workers\u201d Cabana said. On the part of formal sector workers  majority of them are considered as essential workers since they are in the food manufacturing sector. Despite this  no safety guarantees were put in place to ensure testing and quarantine procedures. \u201cNakakabahala  we go to work but we don\u2019t know if we contracted the virus since we have don\u2019t have enough medical support from our employers and the government. Kahit thermal scanner and mass testing  wala\u201d Faigmani added. For SENTRO\u2019s part  Nice Coronation states  \u201cWe need to build up our public health system now; and to to that  we need to have at least 10 percent of the GDP budget be allotted to health. We need to hire more full time health workers with proper remuneration and full protection \u201d \u201cECQ or no ECQ  tuloy ang Laban! No threat of Martial Law will stop us from reaching out to the largest sector of workers. We will make sure Duterte will hear the loudest bang of our hammers and the clamor of workers across the country!\u201d Labog said. KMU and NAGKAISA will hold various forms of actions nationwide both online and offline on May First. #RedLaborDay2020", "comments": "71", "shares": "146", "reactions": {"all": " 306", "likes": "239", "love": "54", "wow": "9", "haha": "3", "sad": 0, "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2813671918749345", "author": "Charles DeMoss", "date": "Apr 22  2020", "content": "Opinion\nI'm not saying Covid-19 isn't real...

Is it a coincidence that just when the economy is booming  the stock market is setting record highs  we are winning the trade wars  school shootings have stopped  our nation is at peace  the Democratic party is a disaster and so is their likely nominee(Biden). He hasn't a chance in hell & they're not about to let an outsider(Bernie) destroy their scheme. It looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment  then all the sudden world crisis pandemic. Stock market tumbles  companies are laying off employees  everything is closed and canceled  CEO's of giant companies are resigning and indictments are coming. Now they say there are a couple ways a President doesn't win reelection. Those are an unpopular war or a poor economy. But there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment. Especially the fact that it(Corona virus)originated in China who we are in a global trade war with brought on by Trump. Let's not forget Biden's back door deals with CHINA as well. China doesn't want 4 more years of Trump either. It all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election. Couldn't have hit at a more perfect time. With the Democrats running out of campaign talking points in light of no school shootings  no migrant caravans at the southern border  fighting in Syria winding down  North Korea not firing missiles and Trump beating a sham impeachment. The corona virus gave them one last hail Mary to try and point fingers at Trump with the clock winding down in 2020. This is almost the perfect fascist playbook. Control the population with fear-mongering and panic  control the media  spread propaganda and the fan-favorite disarm the population. Oh  and did anyone notice that while they are mad as hell at Trump for not sending aid to Ukraine  they THEMSELVES voted AGAINST giving ANY emergency aid to all Americans ? Sorry but I don't think we are all going to die. Remember when Ebola was what was going to kill us all and the media kept showing the piles of body bags that were prepared for the fallout. Then a month later it was totally forgotten. The common flu has killed more people this year already and the media is SILENT!\nA handful of deaths out of 320 million Americans and we are in panic tearing down our society and costing our economy billions in the wake.

Today we have the first data.\nPatients go to CPR for Generalized Venous Thromboembolism  especially TEP Pulmonary Thromboembolia.\nIf so  CPR and intubation are useless because first and foremost you have to dissolve the thrombus  actually prevent these thromboembolies. If you ventilate a lung where the blood isn't coming  it's not necessary! In fact 9 out of 10. patients die\nGentlemen  Covid1 9 damages first of all the vases  the cardiovascular apparatus  and only then it gets to the lungs!!!\nIt's venous microthrombosis  not pneumonia that determine fatality! And why are trumpets forming? Because inflammation as per school text  induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known physiopathological mechanism. So what  then? What scientific literature  especially Chinese  said until mid-March  was that anti-inflammatories should not be used. Now in Italy we use anti-inflammatories and antibiotics (as in influences) and the number of hospitalized people collapsed.\nMany deaths  even 40 years old  had a history of high fever for 10-15 days not properly cured. Inflammation here destroyed everything and prepared the ground for trumpet formation. Because the main problem isn't the virus  but the immune reaction that destroys the cells where the virus enters. In fact in all departments\nCOVID never came in sick with rheumatoid arthritis and that's because I'm in cortison therapy. This is the main reason why hospitalizations in Italy are starting to decrease and it's becoming a treatable disease at home. By taking care of her well at home  you avoid not only hospitalization  but also thrombotic risk. It wasn't easy to understand because the signs of microembolism are faded  even in the eye of an echocardiologist.\nComparing the data of the first 50 patients between those who breathe badly and those who don't  the situation has become very clear to all doctors in Italy  from cardiologists  radiologists  to anatom-pathologists and to colleagues in Intensive Therapies.\nTime to publish these data and you could start getting the population out of quarantine  not immediately  but shorter than expected.\nIn USA where anti-inflammatories are still prohibited  data is now more tragic than in Italy. These are drugs that cost few euros but help save so many LIVES. These are the drugs we do to go on holiday in Kenya and prevent malaria to understand each other. This testimony of vasculitis with pulmonary thromboembolism results would be confirmed by the protocols of some other hospitals:\nat the Sacco they damage Clexane to everyone  with predictive D-Dimer: the taller the pcs will answer.\nat St. Gerard of Monza Clexane and cortisone\nat Sant ' Orsola di Bologna Clexane everyone + protocol shared with family doctors prescribing Plaquenil rain on all pcs. monosymptomatic at home. Integrated with an anti-inflammatory statement: Brufen anti-inflammatory drugs  naproxene  aspirin that inhibit cox1 as well as Cox 2 should not be used \nWhile celecoxib (a selective Cox 2 inhibitor) seems to be delivering good results  we still need to wait for studies  instead this analysis shows the need to use in the intermediate stages of the disease (start of cough and before breathing difficulties) one Low molecular weight heparin at high doses... (Clexane 8.000 IU / day). Avoid (so as not to burden the exposure too much  and because the text is too medical) to report an interesting testimony from an anatomy pathologist: just think that Bergamo's \u2032\u2032 Pope John XXIII \u2032\u2032 performed 50 autopsies and the \u2032\u2032 Sacco \u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032 of Milan 20 (the Italian one is the highest case in the world  the Chinese have only done 3 and \u2032\u2032 minimally invasive \u2032\u2032). Everything that comes out seems to fully confirm the above information. In a nutshell  it seems that exitus is determined by a DIC (for non-doctors  Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) triggered by the virus. So interstitial pneumonia had nothing to do with it  it was just a diagnostic mistake: we doubled the places in CPR  with exorbitant costs  probably unnecessarily. In hindsight  I think about all those Rx Torax we commented on about a month ago: those images that were interstitial pneumonia might actually be completely consistent with an INTRAVASCULATED COAGULATION.", "comments": "3", "shares": "33", "reactions": {"all": " 36", "likes": "31", "love": 0, "wow": "5", "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "708814009957195", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100009159217540", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "239550293775797", "author": "Vickie Wright", "date": "Apr 29  2020", "content": "They sure as hell wouldn't get In my house!", "comments": "35", "shares": "72", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "10222013927288054", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2719374768276789", "author": "Joey Noyce", "date": "April 27  2020 at 2:37 PM", "content": "Everyone needs to read this before they slag the government off!

Firstly THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ORDER EQUIPMENT for the NHS  they supply the money. The lazy arse MANAGERS of the NHS are the procurement sources. It's not the government that deals with the logistics for the NHS  it's yes you've guessed it the NHS  more piss poor NHS management (government sorted that by giving them the Army). Two years ago there was a major exercise about the country being prepared for a possible pandemic  the government did NOT run that exercise  the NHS did  which they used their fantastic line \"we can flex\" so they were supposedly in a good place  add to that now Brexit with all the stockpiles that we had  they sat there and told the government we are ok. Did the MANAGERS then pre empt the 4 weeks pipeline ordering (that's how long it takes container ship to come from......CHINA).... oh how did we end up in that situation  well you stopped ordering from local sources  mistake all the eggs in one basket  who did that  not the government the NHS procurement. With the care homes now screaming out for PPE shouting at the government  oh wait the majority of care home are PRIVATE business's  84% to be exact. It is not the responsibility of the government to order PPE for the private care homes  the others are COUNCIL led therefore which ever banner they are under it is down to them. There are all these people hiding behind the government when in reality it is those MANAGERS who have fucked up. Not to worry though all our stirling journalists and crayon munching joe public who believe the tripe they publish  to bash the government  one because they didn't vote for Brexit and two because the toxic crayons have got to them. The real joe public know our media are shite in almost every quarter and the muppets that chuck the stones from the sidelines  you know the ones that are armchair virologist/strategy professionals who could do oh so much better....NOT. The government has made mistakes  but not as many as the media would have you believe  instead of trying to pull this country together it seeks to divide  we don't need this at this crucial time  stop reading the gutter press  the armchair freaks STFU we need to get through this and your incessant squeaking is nothing but oxygen waste.

Firstly THE GOVERMENT DOES NOT ORDER EQUIPMENT for the NHS  they supply the money. The lazy arse MANAGERS of the NHS are the procurement sources. It's not the government that deals with the logistics for the NHS  it's yes you've guessed it the NHS  more piss poor NHS management (goverment sorted that by giving them the Army). Two years ago there was a major exercise about the country being prepared for a possible pandemic  the government did NOT run that exercise  the NHS did  which they used their fantastic line \"we can flex\" so they were supposedly in a good place  add to that now Brexit with all the stockpiles that we had  they sat there and told the goverment we are ok. Did the MANAGERS then pre empt the 4 weeks pipeline ordering (thats how long it takes container ship to come from......CHINA).... oh how did we end up in that situation  well you stopped ordering from local sources  mistake all the eggs in one basket  who did that  not the goverment the NHS procurement. With the care homes now screaming out for PPE shouting at the goverment  oh wait the majority of care home are PRIVATE business's  84% to be exact. It is not the responsibility of the goverment to order PPE for the private care homes  the others are COUNCIL led therefore which ever banner they are under it is down to them. There are all these people hiding behind the goverment when in reality it is those MANAGERS who have fucked up. Not to worry though all our stirling journalists and crayon munching joe public who believe the tripe they publish  to bash the goverment  one because they didn't vote for Brexit and two because the toxic crayons have got to them. The real joe public know our media are shite in almost every quarter and the muppets that chuck the stones from the sidelines  you know the ones that are armchair virologist/stratergy professionals who could do oh so much better....NOT. The goverment has made mistakes  but not as many as the media would have you believe  instead of trying to pull this country together it seeks to divide  we don't need this at this crucial time  stop reading the gutter press  the armchair freaks STFU we need to get through this and your insessant squeaking is nothing but oxygen waste. Lets get through this and beat this  as it is not over yet  not by a long chalk.", "comments": "0", "shares": "509", "reactions": {"all": " 248", "likes": "228", "love": "11", "wow": "1", "haha": "2", "sad": "3", "angry": "3", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10156876166661809", "author": "Tops Dizon", "date": "Apr 26  2020", "content": "no filter  see the difference\nsomewhere in metro manila\n\nday 1 vs 8 vs 43 quarantine period \ud83c\udf0f\n\n#201of365\n#365picTops", "comments": "31000", "shares": "111509", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10156752940911809", "author": "Tops Dizon", "date": "Mar 23  2020", "content": "yup. air quality is definitely cleaner.\n\nsomething positive about the quarantine period.", "comments": "7", "shares": "19", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10159661080303625", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100050122365246", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "909802626143920", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "3186688658041607", "author": "Nadeep Darmadasa", "date": "April 24  2020 at 11:14 PM", "content": "All school students are fully insured.

The first image is from a Getty photographer\ufffc\ufffc who appears to have been shooting with a professional camera and a telephoto lens. A lens like this  likely in the 200-400mm range\ufffc  gives a compressed look. Think football photos in the newspaper. The second shot is from my personal live coverage on WJXT at 6 PM Friday. On the left side is live video from my photographer partner who is on the sand with me. On the right side is live video from our helicopter above. You will notice that the left appears to show more people than the right. We showed you both for transparency. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffcThe third and fourth photos are from our Panasonic video camera which we used to go live. There\u2019s me. Proof I was there.\ufffc The fifth photo is another split screen example. I took the sixth and seventh photos with my iPhone 11  one pointing north in the other pointing south  around 6:15 PM. \ufffc The eighth photo was taken by a lifeguard in Jax Beach around the same time. The moral of the story is  different cameras  different lenses and different angles make the beach look differently. There was not a secret meeting for reporters and photographers to mislead the public.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc Quite frankly  we have all been so busy that we wouldn\u2019t have time to doctor anything. If you take the miles of beaches up and down Duval County  there were indeed thousands of people. However  most kept their distance. And there was a lot of sand. This post is not about whether opening the beaches is safe or not. That\u2019s not my area of expertise. I\u2019m not a health expert or a lawmaker. \ufffcKindly lay off local journalists working hard to cover a situation. I can assure you almost all of us  my competitors included  have good  honest intentions of keeping you informed and safe. A helicopter shot looks different from a drone shot which looks different from a telephoto shot which looks different from a smart phone shot. \ufffc The optics are different. The angles are different.\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc As your car mirrors say  objects may appear further than they are. Use your best judgement. Thank you to all who continue to support and trust local journalism. Our jobs depend on it.\n\ufffc", "comments": "0", "shares": "1773", "reactions": {"all": 1100, "likes": "879", "love": "214", "wow": "9", "haha": "5", "sad": 0, "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid":

Instead  it is spreading in a country like Switzerland  in the same way it is spreading in the desert areas. Whereas if it were natural  it would have spread in cold places  but died in hot places.\n\nI have done 40 years of research on animals and viruses. It is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have worked for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I am fully acquainted with all the staff of that laboratory. I have been phoning them all  after the Coronavirus surfaced. But all their phones are dead for the last 3 months. It is now understood that all these lab technicians have died.\n\nBased on all my knowledge and research till date  I can say this with 100% confidence - That the Coronavirus is not natural. It did not come from bats. China manufactured it. If what I am saying today is proved false now or even after my death  the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize.

He could have made a significant difference to the current COVID-19 situation in the country if not for his denial of the pandemic's gravity  and lack of foresight and preparedness. The administration has missed one opportunity after another to prevent and contain the spread of the disease early on. Enhanced community quarantine can do very little without the necessary mass testing  and provision of expedient government support. As much as Sec. Duque is accountable for all these  he cannot be scapegoated for the overall delays and mispriorities in the COVID-19 response. Thus  Kabataan Partylist supports the Senate Resolution calling for Sec. Duque's resignation. The youth party-list would like to stress  however  that it should not be just Sec. Duque  but the Duterte regime  at the helm of COVID-19 response and with the President delegated with emergency powers  must be held all the more accountable. Three weeks since the grant of emergency powers to the President  less than half  or only 5-million out of the 18-M supposed beneficiaries  have received aid from the Social Amelioration Program. Delayed distribution of livelihood and economic relief for the most vulnerable has endangered the poor with hunger and destitution more than the coronavirus. Even health workers  risking everything in the front lines  are not exempt from this administration\u2019s criminal negligence with insufficient to no timely provision of PPEs. These blunders should never be taken lightly because of fatal consequences. According to latest reports  at least 21 health workers and medical professionals have died combatting COVID-19 due to exposure to the virus and lack of protective gear. The one-month period for the enhanced community quarantine has already passed. Yet  even with its extension  the government\u2019s lack of a comprehensive plan to address the health crisis and combat the COVID-19 remains glaring. The report of Deep Knowledge Venture  a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm that focuses on health care and longevity technology  that the Philippines is the least safe country in the Asia Pacific amid the COVID-19 pandemic  reflects this. Its evaluation is based on these parameters: the lowest likelihood of infection  the lowest chance of mortality  and the highest likelihood of recovery based on the efficiency of quarantine and government management  monitoring and detection  and emergency treatment readiness. This should serve not only as a wake-up call  but a push for holding the government accountable for negligence to the plight of millions of marginalized and vulnerable Filipinos. We must unite to intensify our health and socio-economic demands  and push the government to systematize and prioritize response to COVID-19 crisis.###", "comments": "0", "shares": "33", "reactions": {"all": " 119", "likes": "54", "love": "25", "wow": "1", "haha": "31", "sad": "1", "angry": "7", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10221965805320414", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10222298118787068", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "257808218687942", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10219391513115933", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "4221347434545770", "author": "Vytjie Mentor", "date": "April 20  2020 at 6:11 AM", "content": "WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS???", "comments": "0", "shares": "68", "reactions": {"all": " 87", "likes": "61", "love": "2", "wow": "13", "haha": "11", "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "1408815445853353", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "3218507754881088", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "1138664983152597", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100010273179241", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100025099920263", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "638449496", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2596264337278284", "author": "Justin Bielinski", "date": "April 20  2020 at 9:07 PM", "content": "Tomorrow I embark on a new adventure!

Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook  I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all  I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark  he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well  you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases  people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally  you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah  you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark  they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now  the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease  if they had mild symptoms  we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes  they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1 765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact  you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH  that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble  your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home  don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case  they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES  ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally  people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30  he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people  their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34  he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES  but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes  they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda  USC  UCLA  Stanford  U of Washington  etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes  but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately  this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes  they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes  they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat  the clothes you wear  the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them.

Key takeaways are as follows.\n*General Outlook*\n1. India seems to have supressed the curve so far. It looks like it might escape the worst of the pandemic  but will have to be cautious about it.\n2. Possibility of W Curve \u2013 i.e. There is a good chance of re-occurrence of the virus  which could see a possibility of regular lockdowns. Businesses need to plan accordingly.\n3. Capital will look for countries that are less battered. Western economies are badly battered while countries like India  Indonesia  etc are not so battered. Global Capital could flow into India  if we can act efficiently to pull it.\n4. Emotional and Economic backlash against China is expected. Already  countries and companies are working on strategy to pivot away from China as part of their supply chains. Japan Govt has announced packages for it\u2019s companies bringing back manufacturing home. Businesses need to keep this in mind and work accordingly. *Discretionary Spending.*\n1. For individuals  health and safety will become No.1 on their agenda from the 3rd of 4th place. There will be more spending on this area and reduction in other discretionary spends.\n2. The ticket size of spending will drop for a while. People will spend on cheaper goods than on expensive goods  or delay spending for a while.\n3. Extreme acceleration in digital economy. I.e. Home education  home entertainment  home fitness  etc\n4. Loyalty shock. People will be less loyal towards brands as other aspects will take over. People will switch brands faster due to various other concerns like safety  etc.\n5. General Trust deficit. There will be trust deficit amongst stakeholders like vendors  customers  employees  borrowers  banks  etc. Banks will have trust deficit with borrowers  companies will have trust deficit with suppliers  etc. *Liquidity and P&L*\n1. Segregate Good Costs and Bad Costs\na. Good costs (Eg. Digitization  tech costs  digital marketing  best employees  etc) need to be insulated and protected\nb. Bad Costs (Eg. Fancy office  unnecessary spending  bad performers  traditional working methods) need to be ruthlessly eliminated. Don\u2019t be emotional about non-core businesses. Concentrate on core business.\n2. Be Frugal \u2013 Not necessary to have fancy office  fancy cars  excess employee strength  etc. Remove all the flab and be lean.\n3. Maintain Good behaviour \u2013 have frank and open conversation with all stakeholders like suppliers  employees  etc and try to find the middle ground  so that the burden can be shared justly.\n4. Be Future Ready \u2013 In this crisis  there will be winners and there will be losers. Those who re-orient their strategy will be winners. *Govt Stimulus.*\n1. Economy was in poor shape even before Covid. The govt has little leeway to provide large stimulus.\n2. Govt earns about $60-70 billion a week from taxes. Imagine what a hit a 5-week lockdown will have. Size of Indian economy is about $3 Trillion. In some scenarios  it is predicted that Govt could take a hit of nearly $1 Trillion.\n3. Inequality has already sharpened. The gap between rich and poor has further increased. Govt needs to concentrate on mass health and mass welfare. If not  200 million people could sink into poverty.\n4. Govt must explore printing currency (Quantitative easing)  but there are limitations here. It has side effects like inflation  etc. Rich countries have more leeway for such quantitative easing.\n5. Govt must concentrate on grabbing more capital from outside and do reforms to enable that. *Result of backlash against China*\n1. Internationally  there could be an emotional and economic backlash against China.\n2. Businesses with supply chains passing through China will need to keep this in mind and insulate themselves and build alternatives.\n3. India and Indian businesses need to try to become the contract manufacturer of the world  just like China is. India needs to make use of this opportunity smartly.\n4. All big wealth funds and soverign funds will be awash with Liquidity. This liquidity needs to be attracted to India.\n5. In every sector  there are good and bad companies. Management has to invest correctly in manufacturing and modern tech  be honest and fair to all stakeholders  etc.  Those companies with good management and displaying good behaviour will come out victorious. *Export Business*\n1. Indian exporters need to build trust. They need live up to promises made. They need to deliver on time and deliver the promised quality. They shouldn\u2019t make incorrect promises just to get more business.\n2. Bangladesh export business has built trust and a good reputation. Despite a chequered past (low quality  human rights issues  etc) they have managed to overcome and are winning. *Wholesale  Retail  etc.*\n1. More people will prefer to buy from retail stores where there is perception of safety (Eg. Sanitation  cleanliness  crowds  etc). They will move more towards malls away from markets. Many will move towards online stores. Wholesale suppliers also need to concentrate on such retailers.\n2. Customers also need to be ringfenced:\na. A high end restaurant in Delhi is giving 40% of bill value as a gift coupon to be used anytime upto December 2020.\nb. Car companies are giving buy back offers  incase the customer loses his job in the next one year.\n3. Pricing needs to be re-approached. People are looking for cheaper prices or cheaper goods. *Brick & Mortar in Discretionary Spends.*\n1. Cinemas could take a big hit in the near future. Entertainment could move home.\n2. Because of this  cafes and restaurants might see some increase in business. Many chains are implementing measures like social distancing like lesser furniture  etc  to build confidence to consumers.\n3. Smaller retailers need to send a message of safety. Eg: Have sanitisers  put up notice of no Covid positive employee found in the store  maintain social distancing  etc.\n4. Since travel and tourism will take a big hit  connected purchases will also shift. Purchases that happened abroad will happen at home. (Eg. Electronics  Luxury goods and apparel  etc. ). But travel related purchases will drop. *Real Estate*\n1. Indian real estate economy is sitting on a huge inventory with a huge cost-of-carry\n2. The industry is highly leveraged with low margins.\n3. Unsold inventory is considered as an appreciating asset  but might turn out to be a flawed view.\n4. Market was already overdue for a huge reset  which will be accelerated by the pandemic.\n5. Also  the sharing and co-working space could be hit as more businesses try to have their own smaller spaces and more WFH employees. *Jewellery etc.*\n1. Gold-as-an-asset could see appreciation.\n2. Jewelry  as a discretionary spend  will take a hit.\n3. The Indian wedding industry will take a hit  as social distancing  cost consciousness  travel avoidance  etc.  will prevent fat weddings  destination weddings  etc. This will hit all connected industries. (Eg. Silk  partywear  etc) *Financial Markets*\n1. There will be value destruction and value creation in different companies in the same sector.\n2. High Debt low margin companies will find it difficult. (indicates risky or unscrouplus management)\n3. High Debt high margin companies could be rewarded  but caution needs to be exercised. (may indicate sharp or dynamic management)\n4. No debt high margin companies are best rewarded now.\n5. Know more about the CEO and management and their actions and activities.\n(Eg: 3 branches of Starbucks were kept open in India for last few days. The CEO of Starbucks India sat in the Fort (Mumbai) branch throughout the day to give his employees confidence and motivation)\n6. New tech unicorns will be born. Those involved in cyber security  cloud services  online education services  etc. *Forex Markets*\n1. No doomsday scenario (i.e. Dollar will become 90 rupees etc). Such scenarios don\u2019t seem realistic\n2. Govt should be buying as much oil as possible  as such prices may never be seen in the future of oil.\n3. As the western economies are more battered and Indian economy is less battered so far  there is more liquidity coming in. That\u2019s why there is a rally in the market. This scenario could change depending on the spread of the disease in India.\n4. Watch out for sharp spikes in the market. Better to avoid the spikes. *Outlook for near future.*\n*A. Large Companies*\na. Huge concern seen for employees. Companies are paying the employees even when closed.\nb. HUL Decided not to cut a single rupee for their suppliers  service providers  etc. No haircuts.\nc. Safety of employees and customers is becoming a major point of focus.\nd. This is possible because they have reserves of funds  etc that have been built up over the years. *B. Medium and Small businesses.*\na. They have to work with thin capital reserves. Excess capital is taken out of the business and applied into personal assets.\nb. Small businesses take out the surplus and purchase personal assets instead of re-investing in the business. There are various factors and motivations here.\nc. Because of this  they are unable to meet the cash expenses of even the next month.\nd. A high end restaurant chain in Delhi (with Rs.40 crore annual turnover) is unable to pay the salaries of the current month as it has no liquid reserve. Owner has invested in personal assets like house in London  etc.\ne. Medium and Small business need to have a look at how they can build some business reserves to endure such disruptions. *\u201cForce Majeure\u201d in Contracts*\n1. Should force majeure clauses be triggerd in various contracts like rent  supply  etc? It will lead to litigation  but there is no point in getting into litigation now.\n2. All parties have been affected by the crisis. The tenants  the landlords  the lenders/financiers  etc.\n3. Parties need to sit across the table and find a common ground and mutually decide upon the costs  rentals  etc. Burden has to be shared. *Work From Home Scenario.*\n1. It is possible for lot of employees to not visit the office and still be productive.\n2. In RBL corporate office  it is found that it is enough that only 30% staff stay in the office. Others can be connected from homes. This leads to lesser commute expense  stress of the commute  time wasted  etc. \n3. Parents can take care of children more effectively when WFH. There can be dark hours when no calls will be made  etc.  *Optimism*\nAs per a McKinsey survey of entrepreneurs released few days ago  53% of Indian entrepreneurs are optimistic  while only 25% of Japanese entrepreneurs are optimistic.\nIt seems to be a mild U-Curve for the Indian economy. But the descent has not stopped yet.", "comments": "1", "shares": "3", "reactions": {"all": "3", "likes": "3", "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "1422210207981222", "author": "Shiva Chintu", "date": "Apr 21  2020", "content": "*\u0c2e\u0c28 \u0c26\u0c17\u0c4d\u0c17\u0c30\u0c41\u0c28\u0c4d\u0c28 \u0c15\u0c42\u0c30\u0c17\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c32 \u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d \u0c24\u0c4b \u0c2a\u0c4b\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c42\u0c21\u0c02\u0c21\u0c3f. \u0c2e\u0c23\u0c3f\u0c2a\u0c42\u0c30\u0c4d \u0c15\u0c42\u0c30\u0c17\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c32 \u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d \u0c0e\u0c32\u0c3e \u0c09\u0c02\u0c26\u0c4b.*\nSee Translation", "comments": "0", "shares": "4", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "272644193763807", "author": "\u0c30\u0c35\u0c40\u0c02\u0c26\u0c30\u0c4d \u0c35\u0c02\u0c1c\u0c30\u0c3f", "date": "Apr 23  2020", "content": "\u0c2e\u0c3f\u0c1c\u0c4b\u0c30\u0c02 \u0c32\u0c4b \u0c15\u0c42\u0c30\u0c17\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c32 \u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d \u0c13 \u0c28\u0c35\u0c40\u0c28 \u0c35\u0c3f\u0c27\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c02 \u0c05\u0c35\u0c32\u0c02\u0c2c\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c1a\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41. \u0c2e\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c2e\u0c28 \u0c30\u0c3e\u0c37\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c02\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c15\u0c42\u0c21 \u0c08 \u0c35\u0c3f\u0c27\u0c02\u0c17\u0c3e \u0c2e\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c15\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d \u0c32\u0c41 \u0c1a\u0c47\u0c2f\u0c28\u0c47\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c2a\u0c02\u0c21\u0c3f \u0c05\u0c27\u0c3f\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c30\u0c41\u0c32\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3e\u0c30..\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\nSee Translation", "comments": "2", "shares": "257", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "10222076334046292", "author": "Nadia Marie", "date": "April 21  2020 at 11:20 AM", "content": " ", "comments": "11", "shares": "3067", "reactions": {"all": " 805", "likes": "25", "love": "3", "wow": "2", "haha": "773", "sad": "1", "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "2483065768614434", "author": "Hiru Micky", "date": "Apr 14  2020", "content": "Lockdown n social distancing for some poeple In India \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "comments": "18", "shares": "727", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "820526268357671", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2367267950170655", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10158790625794881", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2762495757211661", "author": "\u10db\u10dd\u10eb\u10e0\u10d0\u10dd\u10d1\u10d0 \u10eb\u10da\u10d4\u10d5\u10d0\u10d8 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d9\u10d5\u10d8\u10e0\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10d8", "date": "April 20  2020 at 7:51 PM", "content": "", "comments": "2", "shares": "39", "reactions": {"all": " 26", "likes": "18", "love": "3", "wow": 0, "haha": "5", "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "1549687368528301", "author": "Wade Grojean", "date": "April 20  2020 at 7:45 AM", "content": "BREAKING NEWS: ARE YOU SITTING DOWN???
