the disease. Some of these tips were frank fake (hello  warm water rinse: https://bit.ly/2UriuMb) But what to do with ibuprofen \u2753\nHe was first advised  then banned. More  some media came out with headlines to use ibuprofen if you have symptoms of coronavirus - \u2032\u2032 pure suicide \". And as for real \u2753\nLet's figure it out. The post will be updated regularly on the latest data on ibuprofen - so stay tuned! \u25aa News that ibuprofen cannot be coronavirus patients has flown after it was announced by French Minister of Health Olivier Veran.\n\u25aa Before that  similar data was published in the medical magazine The Lancet (https://bit.ly/2UpVP2G) and reported that ibuprofen allegedly unofficial was not recommended in hospitals in Vienna (https://bit.ly/33ov4Qm).\n\u25aa Subsequently  on March 17  WHO speaker Christian Lindmeier at a press conference really said it's better to avoid ibuprofen and better drink paracetamol until there's deeper research. And here it was about self-medication!\n\u25aa If ibuprofen attributed a specialist  Lindmeier added  he better know (https://bit.ly/3bazwVu).\nSimilar opinion and the British National Health Service: they say there is no convincing evidence against ibuprofen yet. But they recommend paracetamol - because there is not enough information yet (https://bit.ly/2Wwb2SI).\n\u25aa However  on March 18  the WHO stated on its official Twitter account: from the current information the organization has no recommendations against ibuprofen (https://bit.ly/2U9F2lP). So everyone was wrong \u2753\n\u25aa In fact  the situation is not easy. It takes a lot of time to confirm and test every medical hypothesis. Unlike social networks - here hypotheses turn into \u2032\u2032 facts \u2032\u2032 in minutes.\n\u25aa Therefore  we urge our readers not only to search for proven information  but also to have patience to wait for it. \u26a0 In addition  at the first symptoms of respiratory illness  it is better to consult with your family doctor  not to wonder if you can use ibuprofen in self-medication. \u27a1U Telegram channel right now telling if coronavirus treats Decasan (spoiler - nit): t.me/voxcheck", "comments": "0", "shares": "3", "reactions": {"all": " 43", "likes": "42", "love": "1", "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2605062826406481", "author": "Bobby Coy", "date": "March 15  2020 at 2:09 PM", "content": "If any parents have run out of formula or are running low - call the number on the back of your canister and explain to them the virus has affected your abilities to find any formula - they will send you a case free of charge!

CEO of disney stepped down CEO of Tinder  Hinge  OKcupid  Match all stepped down CEO of Hulu stepped down CEO of MedMen stepped down CEO of L brands like Victoria Secret bath and body works stepped down CEO of Salesforce's stepped down CEO of Harley Davidson stepped down CEO of IBM stepped down CEO of T Mobile stepping down CEO of LinkedIn stepping down CEO of Mastercard is stepping down And soooooo many more  but let's just stick with these that most know about. Weird they stepped down right before \"Corona Virus scare\" almost like they all knew it was coming \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Following it stocks seen their biggest crash in recorded history  worse than great depression or the early 2000s hit  crypto markets started following suit. And governments are shutting things down left and right. \"Corona virus omg!\" This was a planned epidemic that needed a face to it for the masses to follow it blindly like the blind sheep the majority is. This was planned for decades in advance with many short \"scares\" coming like Ebola and the countless other \"epidemics\" to prepare the human mind for the grand finale \"CoronaVirus\" omg! It is nothing more than a face. \"But cody! All the governments are on it!\" The world is all a 1 world government for the major part  you just been to blind to see it. This is larger than an attack on the elections This is larger than an attack on china as a global manufacturing hub. This is larger than an attack on a single economy like the united states who just entered their largest economic collapse that will make the great depression look like a joke. This is the forced introduction into a new era. The online world. Following this will be mass closures of brick and mortar stores The largest housing market collapse to date. A huge shift in power and money on a global scale. The largest lay off of jobs  because they have been a scam for so long  now they are finally going away. This is all to make room for the largest influx of automation coming. Malls will turn into warehouses and shipping facilities. Big department stores as well. This is the rise of virtual sports and the first test of a mass market of it. Virtual reality is about to be massively introduced. This is a massive shift off offline to online. Of manual labor to automation. \"Omg corona virus!\" Keep thinking that. Your the first to go when this mass extinction comes  because it is coming. Homeless rates will hit all time highs. Foreclosures will hit all time highs. Lay offs will hit all time highs. Stores will run out of food and necessities. Those who didnt prepare for this wont get help as there wont be anything to help them with. America will be hit hardest  because americans well... let's face it  some of the laziest people on planet earth  just facts. They dont prepare they just react  and reacting wont help you in this case. If you dont already have automated income  work from home stuff going  and I mean work from home for yourself  not a company  in other words  your not collecting a paycheck  then your too late and better start finding anway online get it and learn it because it will be your best bet. You can see this as the worlds largest economic collapse  you would be right. Nothing will compare to thos one. You can see this as the begining of world war 3  you are probably right on that  but it wont look anything like world war 1 or 2  it is done much differently with media control  fear introduction  and using \"the people\" as the weapon. Control the people  control anything u want. And media has conditioned people to not be able to think for themselves for this exact moment. You can see this as the next black plague and your probably right  but it wont have to do with corona virus again. It's just the face of this. I could make this post go on forever. But let's keep it at that. Share this  wake up  now is not the time to play games  to take a break  to sit at home. No one is safe from what is to come  and that is why the CEOs stepped down  they know it's time to prepare for something much bigger than themselves and had warning before any of us. The elite always have the upper hand. Share this. And let's wake up to what is truly happening Prepare For The Storm Q\n\"Here is some inside info you won't hear on the news: This morning  at 4:30AM  our\u2026 More  ", "comments": "11000", "shares": "2090", "reactions": {"all": " 602", "likes": "404", "love": "64", "wow": "66", "haha": "58", "sad": "7", "angry": "3", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "547594639196900", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2389099161191480", "author": "TeluguSTOP.com", "date": "March 14  2020 at 6:00 AM", "content": "\u0c35\u0c3f\u0c26\u0c47\u0c36\u0c3e\u0c32\u0c32\u0c4b \u0c39\u0c3e\u0c28\u0c40\u0c2e\u0c42\u0c28\u0c4d \u0c15\u0c3f \u0c35\u0c46\u0c33\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c3f\u0c35\u0c1a\u0c4d\u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c28 \u0c1c\u0c02\u0c1f\u0c15\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c30\u0c4b\u0c28\u0c3e ..", "comments": "5", "shares": "24", "reactions": {"all": " 208", "likes": "164", "love": "1", "wow": "2", "haha": "40", "sad": "1", "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2648766678715989", "author": "Upset Californian Conservative", "date": "March 11  2020 at 10:42 AM", "content": "Who else agrees?", "comments": "282", "shares": "11885", "reactions": {"all": 1100, "likes": "969", "love": "17", "wow": "36", "haha": "54", "sad": "20", "angry": "32", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "518478152421538", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "518087275753040", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10215888963552431", "author": "Jim Kelley", "date": "Mar 12  2020", "content": "So please take a minute and study this table !

In any case  do not forget about protection: wash your hands  take care of yourself and your loved ones \u2764", "comments": "0", "shares": "3", "reactions": {"all": " 59", "likes": "46", "love": "5", "wow": 0, "haha": "7", "sad": 0, "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2793519207369704", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2702186989896068", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2029450593867865", "author": "Vytautas Kasiulevicius", "date": "Mar 11  2020", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "3", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "3429873857029078", "author": "Amaresh Panda", "date": "Mar 11  2020", "content": "Strange coincidence that all worst affected Covid19 cases are along the same Latitude 40\u0e4d :\nFrom left:\nFrance Italy Iran Wuhan S.Korea Japan Seattle Washington NewYork.", "comments": "1", "shares": "1", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "902420906867055", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "656588935100478", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "145158293630450", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2103517333127668", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10163445636475227", "author": "Planeta.pl", "date": "March 10  2020 at 6:36 AM", "content": "Ostrzegaj\u0105  \u017ce nadci\u0105ga POTWORNA WOJNA\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\udca5", "comments": "26", "shares": "1193", "reactions": {"all": " 68", "likes": "42", "love": 0, "wow": "6", "haha": "6", "sad": "11", "angry": "3", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "3116465201717711", "author": "Medycyna naturalna - \"klinika-zdrowienia.pl\"", "date": "March 11  2020 at 5:17 PM", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "47", "reactions": {"all": " 13", "likes": "6", "love": 0, "wow": "6", "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": "1", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "10219553902815729", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10220571452226562", "author": "Max Black", "date": "Mar 11  2020", "content": "\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "comments": "2", "shares": "126", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "10163085286800032", "author": "Simone Hermansen", "date": "Mar 10  2020", "content": "Det er da lige til \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0a\nSee Translation", "comments": "6", "shares": "29", "reactions": {"all": "17", "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "1891781660953672", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2888755154540009", "author": "Saint Luke's Health System", "date": "March 11  2020 at 2:04 PM", "content": "False reports are circulating that say drinking alcohol can reduce the risk of COVID-19.

COVID-19 started emerging in early December. Given the incubation period  that means infection started in November  and given international travel and tourism rates  it DID NOT TAKE 3+ months for it to come here. It's been here. I've had numerous friends across the country who've had crazy bad colds in the last few months  that we now believe were actually Coronavirus. US authorities only just started testing for it  and even now the testing is severely limited  so in all likelihood  many have had or do have it  and it's gotten passed off as just a typical cold - because (AHEM  NEWSFLASH) it IS just a bad cold for the vast majority of people who get it. The normal colds and flu that we've already been dealing with kill thousands every season - it just doesn't get talked about because it's nothing new and the media can't use it to panic us at this point. It's sad but expected that elderly and immunocompromised people are prone to complications from those viruses. This is no different. Wash your hands  eat your vegetables  don't touch any old people (for their safety) and calm the heck down. Panic is what's going to crash the market. Panic is what's going to empty stores. Panic is what's going to lead to serious economic impacts from this - YOU are causing economic impacts - not the virus.

The only thing that happened is that a KLM flight from Entebbe International Airport to Amsterdam experienced a technical problem on March 7  2020 and didn't take-off as planned. The flight's failure to take-off was for technical reasons  which is a normal practice in the aviation industry. It had nothing to do with any suspected Corona Virus cases. Please disregard the post.

Once there in tummy...your stomach ACID will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly...the virus can enter your windpipes and into the LUNGS.

Academia Sinica develops antibodies for rapid immune-based test kit of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus Currently available RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus diagnostic tests take about 4 hours to obtain results  with throughput limited by availability of laboratory facilities and trained personnel. To prevent the pandemic spread of the coronavirus  a faster way to detect infected patients is urgently needed. Today  Academia Sinica (AS) proudly announced that the first group of monoclonal antibodies specifically binding the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) has been successfully generated and tested by Dr. An-Suei Yang and his team at the Genomics Research Center in AS. If successfully manufactured and validated  the rapid immune-based test kit could detect coronavirus in only 15 minutes  just like a rapid influenza test. His team produced N proteins from 7 different viral species and screened against these to obtain a few dozen monoclonal antibodies. Out of these few dozen  one antibody against only SARS-CoV-2 N protein  9 against only SARS-CoV N protein  and 36 against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV N proteins were developed. One additional advantage  said Dr. Yang  is that none of these monoclonal antibodies bind any N proteins of the other 5 strains of coronavirus  thus cross-reactivity will not be a problem for the rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. With the help of the Ministry of Economic Affairs  Dr. Yang\u2019s team is working with manufacturers on the development and production of prototypes. In the coming months  they will discuss product validation and certification with the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. They will then work with the Ministry of Health and Welfare to bring a rapid coronavirus test kit to Taiwan to combat this devastating epidemic. #coronavirus #Rapidvirusdetection #antibody #SARSCoV2", "comments": "41000", "shares": "30334", "reactions": {"all": 71000, "likes": 670000, "love": 24000, "wow": 11000, "haha": "278", "sad": "8", "angry": "2", "care": "1"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "152642206264001", "author": "Alcald\u00eda de El Espinal", "date": "May 4  2020 at 11:49 PM", "content": " \ud83d\udea8 Statement from the Administrative Directorate of Health. \ud83d\udea8", "comments": "9", "shares": "43", "reactions": {"all": " 100", "likes": "93", "love": "4", "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": "3"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2681550481913961", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "1939829986160864", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "732911880159516", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "260087851659257", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2601311423447678", "author": "Odkrywamy Zakryte.", "date": "March 10  2020 at 10:30 AM", "content": "Fa\u0142szywa pandemia koronawirusa nie zosta\u0142a wywo\u0142ana bezcelowo.

Hiding important public health information from their workers is dangerous. This clearly shows that most bosses and managers don't care about the lives of their workers or their customers. They only care about making profits and they will doom the whole world to put an extra penny in their pockets.\nThat's why universal paid sick leave is essential. If we leave it up to employers  they will ALWAYS choose the option that puts their workers in harm's way.

This is the simplest way to identify.\nPlease tell your friends that if you know more about medical knowledge  you will have more awareness of identification and prevention.\nDirector Zhenxing informed that the Wuhan virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed in a temperature of 26-27 degrees. So drink plenty of hot water. Can tell relatives and friends to drink hot water for prevention.\nFrom a Chinese doctor: To prevent Wuhan virus  as long as the human body maintains heat energy  eat more ginger and exercise more  you will not be infected with the virus. If you have a high fever  cover yourself with a quilt. Drink ginger soup to increase body's heat energy. It can prevent infection. No vaccination required. Eat more ginger  garlic  hot chilies  and pepper. Eat less sweet and sour and bitter. Don't drink too much ice water. Don't go to cold weather areas.\nWhen the sun is in the virus endemic area  the virus will completely disappear.\nEveryone can share and help one by one.\nDr. Khin Maung U.\n*******************", "comments": "0", "shares": "11", "reactions": {"all": "32", "likes": "32", "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "633501430772027", "author": "Nasihat Hussain", "date": "March 4  2020 at 1:18 AM", "content": "The corona virus is large in size with a cell diameter of 400-500 micro  so any mask prevents its entry so there is no need to exploit pharmacists to trade with muzzles.

The corona virus  when it falls on a metal surface  will live for 12 hours  so washing hands with soap and water well will do the trick. Corona virus when it falls on fabrics stays for 9 hours so washing clothes or exposing them to the sun for two hours is enough for the purpose of killing him. The virus lives on the hands for 10 minutes so putting the alcohol sanitizer in the pocket is enough for the purpose of prevention. If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27\u00b0C  it will be killed  it does not live in hot areas. Also drinking hot water and exposure to the sun is good enough.
