Its price is $ 1.5 billion per kilogram (\u00a3 2.2).\nThe drug was first mentioned in the book \u2032\u2032 Fear and Hate in Las Vegas \u2032\u2032 in 1971 Author - Hunter Thompson. The eponymous film with Johnny Depp starring later appeared.\nThe modern elixir of youth is called ADRENOCHROME. This is the seized blood of children with the highest concentration of adrenaline. Blood is extracted from the child's pineal gland at the moment of fear and horror when the adrenaline levels are off the charts. The blood of adults is unfit because with age the pineal iron does not grow and the production of adrenaline falls. As a result of injury  children experience higher adrenaline tides.\n\u2032\u2032 Pedophiles are called ADRENOCHROME \u2032\u2032 Walnut Sauce \"  as the pineal gland resembles walnut or cone. The term was discovered during a 2016 Hillary Clinton correspondence with John Podesta.\n\u2032\u2032 Walnut sauce \u2032\u2032 sounds very innocent  but it's the code satanic vampires use. This is their secret cannibalistic recipe that can't be implemented without sexual abuse  child injuries  tortures over them and their subsequent murder. At the end of torture  they cut out the pineal gland and extract blood. This is a diabolical drink that helps them not to age and get high.\nMal Gibson has repeatedly said that newborn babies are currency in Hollywood's satanic pedophile society.", "comments": "53", "shares": "22", "reactions": {"all": " 35", "likes": "12", "love": 0, "wow": "9", "haha": 0, "sad": "2", "angry": "12", "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "1081694125551274", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2308946919251740", "author": "Chethan Reddy Chetu", "date": "May 13  2020 at 3:21 AM", "content": "Qatar govt was informed that #VandeBharath is an evacuation mission by Air India.

Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics  antivirals  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases  that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected. However  protocols are currently being changed in Italy who have been adversely affected by this pandemic. The impressive case of a Mexican family in the United States who claimed they were cured with a home remedy was documented: three 500 mg aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey  taken hot. The next day they woke up as if nothing had happened to them! Well  the scientific information that follows proves they are right! This information was released by a medical researcher from Italy: \u201cThanks to 50 autopsies performed on patients who died of COVID-19  Italian pathologists have discovered that IT IS NOT PNEUMONIA  strictly speaking  because the virus does not only kill pneumocytes of this type  but uses an inflammatory storm to create an endothelial vascular thrombosis.\u201d In disseminated intravascular coagulation  the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed  but there is also a heart attack  stroke and many other thromboembolic diseases. In fact  the protocols left antiviral therapies useless and focused on anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting therapies. These therapies should be done immediately  even at home  in which the treatment of patients responds very well. If the Chinese had denounced it  they would have invested in home therapy  not intensive care! So  the way to fight it is with antibiotics  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan  20  that is  the Italian series is the highest in the world  the Chinese did only 3  which seems to fully confirm the information. In a nutshell  the disease is determined by a disseminated intravascular coagulation triggered by the virus; therefore  it is not pneumonia but pulmonary thrombosis  a major diagnostic error. Some world leaders doubled the number of resuscitation places in the ICU  with unnecessary exorbitant costs. According to the Italian pathologist  treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. \u201cIf we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate  it is useless  in fact  nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular  not respiratory.\u201d \u201cIt is venous microthrombosis  not pneumonia  that determines mortality.\u201d According to the literature  inflammation induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanism. Unfortunately  what the scientific literature said  especially Chinese  until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used. Now  the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics  as in influenza  and the number of hospitalized patients has been reduced. He also discovered that many deaths  even in their 40s  had a history of fever for 10 to 15 days  which were not treated properly. The inflammation does a great deal of tissue damage and creates ground for thrombus formation. However  the main problem is not the virus  but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed. In fact  patients with rheumatoid arthritis have never needed to be admitted to the ICU because they are on corticosteroid therapy  which is a great anti-inflammatory. With this important discovery  it is possible to return to normal life and open closed deals due to the quarantine  though not immediately  but with time. Kindly share so that the health authorities of each country can make their respective analysis of this information  prevent further deaths and redirect investments appropriately; the vaccine may come later. *linkedin source", "comments": "3", "shares": "19526", "reactions": {"all": 2500, "likes": 19000, "love": "110", "wow": "375", "haha": "55", "sad": "6", "angry": "36", "care": "18"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "2977561859000710", "author": "Jae Quincey", "date": "May 8  2020 at 1:18 AM", "content": "A major study needs to be done on Fauci", "comments": "0", "shares": "2", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "10207422357073105", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100000749169919", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2641987122746361", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2614248318838762", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10223091923624891", "author": "Rikke Louise Andersen", "date": "May 6  2020 at 1:04 AM", "content": "           Then I got to see it  the movie that I received a link to today from no less than 45 people. You MUST watch this 26 minute documentary.\nAnd we'll also get it texted in Danish quite quickly. Here Judy Mikovitz talks about how among others. Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert Gallo stole her work and ignored the HIV / AIDS warnings for months so that the virus could spread and money could be made from medicine. Fauci got Mikovits arrested  got her home searched without court order. Subsequently forced her to silence for 5 years. Same Fauci was banned from Hydroxychloroquine for treatment of resume. Doctors stand to lose their jobs if they use this effective and cheap drug to cure patients. We see the same thing at home where the authorities and the media are so damn busy telling the people that you can do NOTHING but waiting for Bill Gates vaccine. Here is the movie that reveals the whole plot in 26 minutes.\nOnce you've seen it you know how much Judy Mikovitz risks but also why NOBODY can sit this knowledge overheard anymore. EVERYONE who knows how corrupt this industry is and how many crimes it commits and how many lives it has on conscience are obligated to future generations to say massively and claim their knowledge. This is deadly serious. The people who propagandize this pandemic worldwide are one of the most criminals there is. They need to be stopped and if you have just a tiny opportunity to make the slightest difference to stop these psychopaths  you do it NOW.

Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook  I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all  I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark  he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well  you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases  people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally  you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah  you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark  they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now  the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease  if they had mild symptoms  we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes  they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1 765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact  you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH  that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble  your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home  don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case  they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES  ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally  people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30  he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people  their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34  he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES  but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes  they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda  USC  UCLA  Stanford  U of Washington  etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes  but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately  this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes  they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes  they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat  the clothes you wear  the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them.

THIS IS THE MONDAY PILL [Meaning: THE OCTIMISM THAT COMES FROM KNOWN]\n11 May 2020 1. RETIREMENT CONTINUES Retreat is a bit slower than usual today  but it continues. We are therefore at the 1034th consecutive day when the total number of ICU hospitalizations for COVID-19 drops in Italy - from 1034 to 1027  then of \u2032\u2032 sun \u2032\u2032 7 units  but in the meantime we're going down and let's see how tomorrow will go. And it's important that the number of total hospital hospitalizations drops (from 13.834 to 13 618  then 216 units). While the death toll (164) is the lowest in over two months to this side - and this is certainly great news. 2. MONDAY PILL - SIEROLOGI TESTS\nConsidering that we've discussed it on other occasions  I'm reporting the Emory University paper (with eight authors from my department) describing our \u2032\u2032 serological test for COVID-19. The highlights of the study are the strong correlation between the presence of antibodies and the clinical picture  and especially the fact that - when using a good antigen  which is the key point - the ELISA title corresponds to the neutralizing title. I'm rewriting this sentence slower in case the concept escaped: THE ANTICORPES LEVEL MEASURED IN THE SIRUM WITH THE \u2032\u2032 ELISA \u2032\u2032 METHOD RUNS STRETLY WITH THE CAPACITY OF THE SERO TO NEUTRALIZE THE VIRUS *. I hope you have understood the extent of this statement  which is truly remarkable. There wasn't really anything that would make you think otherwise  as coronaviruses aren't known to break out the host's antibody response  as HIV and other viruses do. But it's one thing to predict and it's one thing to prove. Let's also bear in mind that serum neutralization doesn't necessarily mean protection from reinfection... but the two things are very  very close. Kind of like seeing a gentleman sitting in front of a nice smoking carbonara: we can't say for sure that spaghetti will soon end up in his stomach  but it's certainly very likely... The paper was posted yesterday by Jens and Mehul on MedRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.03.20084442v1.full.pdf+html)  and it's also under review for actual publication (fingers crossed). So everyone can read it and discuss it. Two important points to remember: the first is that the subjects studied had SARS-CoV-2 disease  and it's possible that antibody levels are lower (and less able to neutralize) in subjects who had mild infection or asymptomatic. The second caveat is that we obviously don't know yet how long these antibodies will be around - I beg you  don't ask me because we don't know. Despite these limitations  the test in my opinion is a real game changer  now many are using it in the USA and around the world  we'll see. * My friend Alberto Mantovani tells me that an Italian group has unpublished data that highlights exactly the same correlation between \u2032\u2032 binding \u2032\u2032 and \u2032\u2032 neutralizing \u2032\u2032 antibodies of SARS-CoV-2-well  actually  very well  because Nothing pleases more in scientific research than independent confirmations of their own results! 3. GIVE TODAY OUR QUOTIDIAN PANIC: WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE VACCINE Today's prize goes to Il Giornale (the one founded by Montanelli  but which Montanelli has nothing left today)  which highlights the statements of a certain \u2032\u2032 professor \u2032\u2032 Baccho [\" Covid is like Hiv: not Will we ever get the vaccine \"]. Keep reading I find out that \"... Pasquale Mario Bacco  with a team of doctors  found out in February that the virus was circulating as early as last October \". Well  this would be really interesting news  ed So I thought it was important to \u2032\u2032 deepen \". So I discovered that this revolutionary research was conducted by a \u2032\u2032 colleague \u2032\u2032 whose academic affiliation is unavailable and whose PubMed publications equals ZERO. On the other hand  these studies  of which there is no trace in scientific journals  are taken from a series of web sites dedicated to no-vaxx  chemtrails and reptilians that rather spend the evening with a heavy breath mustelide. But the cutest thing about this epoch scoop is that  on the way  it goes from trippin panic to forced nano-denialism. Kinda like Nosferatu  in the middle of a bloody scene  is doing the Qua Qua dance. I quote from the article: \u2032\u2032 This virus is not capable of killing. It's a trivial  simple virus. A positive serum subject doesn't get sick with Covid  because it has HIV which is a much bigger virus using the same Coronavirus receptors  so even in the competition Covid can't get on the same receptors. Wherever there is an adequate immune response is destroyed \". In short  the virus that will never be a vaccine is destroyed by the immune system. Straight logic. I imagine that Gerolamo  Bishop of Caffa  would have called it a topic \u2032\u2032 cut like a sword \". Well come on  we've wasted enough time with this amenable \u2032\u2032 news \". [NB: The HIV genome is less than a third of SARS-CoV-2 and of course the receptors it uses (CD4  CCR4 and CXCR4) have nothing to do with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. (ACE2).] 4. THERAPY WITH PLASMA IN THE MARKS Several friends reported to me that the ethics committee that has to approve clinical trials in the Marche Region would have \u2032\u2032 denied \u2032\u2032 licensing plasma protocol for COVID-19. sufferers. The news  reported by several newspapers  sparked a certain understandable alarm. Briefly I investigated with the help of a few colleagues and found out  as I imagined  that it is NOT a rejection but a request for further clarification  which is normal practice for an ethics committee. For those who know the procedures for scientific publishing  it's not a \u2032\u2032 rejection \"  but a \u2032\u2032 revise and resubmit \". That said  I hope that colleagues on the ethics committee (where some old friends sit) can RAPIDLY approve the protocol As soon as we received the necessary clarifications  especially considering that these studies have been approved and are conducted in numerous centers around the world. 5. INFECTIONS IN MEAT Several  including friends Pier Luigi Lopalco and Elena Fattori  are taking an interest in the curious case of outbreaks of COVID-19 infection in slaughterhouse workers. This is interesting from a virological and epidemiological point of view  except for the places of care  contacts in the working environment have not usually been associated with the transmission of the virus. Hypotheses to explain the phenomenon include physical closeness between operators  low temperatures (the so-called \u2032\u2032 cold chain \u2032\u2032) and also the fact  so far considered as a curiosity  that cattle might be likely to become infected with COVID-19. virus. In this regard I remind you that other Coronavirus diseases are of veterinary interest  such as the classic acute gastroenteritis of pigs caused by TGEV  PEDV  and PDCoV  and enteritis and pneumonia caused by bovine coronavirus  BCV  which binds to the receptor for N-Acetylneuraminic acid (for friends: NANA). Let's hope that in the coming days or weeks we can clarify the causes of this strange and interesting phenomenon. 6. TOWARDS THE END... With at least the first phase of this pandemic coming to an end  the end of the \u2032\u2032 jar \u2032\u2032 of these morning optimism pills  which I tried to dispense with trust in science. Thursday afternoon I'll be back at Alberto Matano  my favorite TV conductor  for Live Life  at 18 pm on RAI UNO  and I really hope it's the last of these \u2032\u2032 appearances \"  even because that would mean mine presence is no longer necessary (and this would be a good sign for everyone). And I don't deny that I can't wait to get back into the grey gold of my laboratory and our experiments  which are delivering very fascinating results. But before we close the column  we'll still talk about COVID-19 vaccines  guessing why SARS-CoV-2 killed so many people  what I think we need to learn from this \u2032\u2032 stick \"  and - dulcis In the end -- I'll tell you how I feel about the much-loved \u2032\u2032 return to normal \u2032\u2032 With this I wish everyone a GOOD WEEK  always in the name of optimism  good mood and rationality.", "comments": "0", "shares": "1358", "reactions": {"all": 3900, "likes": 35000, "love": "228", "wow": "2", "haha": "5", "sad": "2", "angry": 0, "care": "80"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "505605723115398", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "280243595323881", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "2935690066480849", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10163459885270243", "author": "Hashim Lakhani", "date": "May 11  2020", "content": "", "comments": "6", "shares": "362", "reactions": {"all": "36", "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": true},{"id": "10101709513548259", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "10158026622106171", "author": "Brian Mills", "date": "Mar 19  2020", "content": "This 50 only shows 50 coffins - Italy's death toll yesterday was 500.

But those who did they seek sensation they try to find it where it is gone  and even when facts and words speak differently.

The County of Ventura is not removing people from their homes. We have alternative options if needed. Here\u2019s a statement from Doctor Levin. \u201cWhat I would like to say to those people who interpreted what I said as forcibly pulling people from their homes if they become COVID positive is that if I conveyed that  it was a mistake on my part and I apologize for that. I am sensitive to that as well. We have no intention of taking people from the environments they feel safe and comfortable in. To demonstrate our past actions  because they speak louder than words  we have managed over 600 people in our county with COVID-19 and we have not forcibly removed anyone from their home or wherever they wanted to be. We have removed about 7 of our seniors who were living in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCF) and had them admitted to one of our hospitals. This was to protect the other seniors and to observe those hospitalized for worsening of their symptoms. If COVID establishes itself in a LTCF (a nursing home)  it can kill dozens as it did in Washington State. We also placed two homeless people who were COVID positive in a motel because they wanted to return to a crowded camp in the river bottom. Virtually everyone wants to stay in their home. It is safest when such a person can have their own room and bathroom but many of our COVID cases have not been so fortunate. When that is the case  our Communicable Disease nurses find ways of keeping them in their home such that it is still safe for the others who are there.\u201d - Doctor Robert Levin  Public Health Officer County of Ventura. https://vcportal.ventura.org/covid19/docs/VCMC_Ambulatory_Instructions_COVID_Diagnosis.pdf", "comments": "695", "shares": "265", "reactions": {"all": " 384", "likes": "292", "love": "34", "wow": "10", "haha": "9", "sad": "1", "angry": "34", "care": "4"}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "3754819231258658", "author": "", "date": "", "content": "", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": false, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "100026471164999", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "1347604882", "author": "Sorry  something went wrong.", "date": "", "content": "We are working on it and we'll get it fixed as soon as we can. \u00ab Back to Home", "comments": "0", "shares": "0", "reactions": {"all": 0, "likes": 0, "love": 0, "wow": 0, "haha": 0, "sad": 0, "angry": 0, "care": 0}, "is_valid": true, "fact_checked": false},{"id": "1552724998226661", "author": "Jenny Lee", "date": "May 18  2020", "content": "Don\u2019t assume that people who choose not to wear a mask are selfish people.\nBecause I assure you we\u2019re not.\nDon\u2019t assume that we\u2019re just trying to be \u201crebels.\u201d\nBecause I promise you  the rude stares are not enjoyable.\n\nI care about everyone and if you choose to wear a mask  that\u2019s your business.

I have learned that there are many harmful effects of rebreathing Carbon Dioxide (CO2). And CO2 is a gas the body naturally produces as WASTE. We breathe in oxygen (O2) to fuel organs & tissues & the end product is CO2. The balance between these two gases is required for a healthy body. However  when we rebreathe CO2 it can have harmful & sometimes very dangerous effects on the body. When CO2 levels are elevated in the body it is known as Hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can occur for a number of reasons  one of which is rebreathing our own exhaled CO2. Rebreathing CO2 can lead to increased blood pressure  headaches  muscle twitches  rapid heart rate  chest pain  confusion  & even fatigue. In extreme cases  if left untreated  Hypercapnia can lead to organ damage & sometimes even have long standing effects on the brain. UM. HELLO ~ Upper respiratory infection - anyone!? NO TO MASKS.\n\nI only do social distancing to a certain extent  all because I respect others personal space... but not because I'm afraid of my fellow Americans  friends or my neighbors. In fact  I would gladly hug a stranger right now - in public if it was a mutual feeling. Because hugging releases endorphins which uplifts your mood & it also relieves lots of stress... and well ~ there is a whole lotta' stress going on right now in this crazy @ss world.\n\nI have never  ever gotten the flu shot because I don't believe in injecting aluminum  formaldehyde  mercury  monkey cells & aborted fetus cells (just to name a few) directly into my body  blood  muscles. No way!!! AND - I also do not want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of Coronavirus by 36%. NO THANKS!\n\nI will NOT be getting tested for Rona even if I show symptoms  because we have seen so many different stories all over the internet about the tests being contaminated with Coronavirus & now I see a cross contamination with HIV at this point. Plus  I already know they will label it Covid-19 without an actual test & I'll be added to the fake numbers that are increasing this panic all over something I may or may not truly have. I have heard from nurses themselves that say they would just tell me to go home & get some rest ...but seeeeeee  thing is -- I'm smart enough to stay home & away from people when sick or have symptoms of being sick.\n\nAND I know to wash my hands with soap & water because... well  that's just freakin' common sense.\n\nUM  I WILL NOT GET THE VACCINE! The government has never mandated a vaccine ever & I'll be damned if they force me put something in my body  that was created in less than 2 weeks of this \"outbreak\". I'm not a sheep  never will be a sheep & I refuse to be manipulated by the Gov. into thinking they have our best interest at hand. Riiiiiiiggghhht\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI believe in God. I know Jesus is my Savior. I will not live in fear  for I know that God is ultimately in control. So  if you want to stay in your house & never go out because you are \"doing the right thing\" that's fine  that's you  that ain't me though. I'm not going to let the media scare me into thinking this is some kind of mass Pandemic. That's what they want. They wanna shut this country down & here they are ~ doing it right in front of all of our faces. I will continue to go out & support locals as much as possible. I live in my life by \ud83d\ude4f Faith & not by fear.\n\nLook folks -- just start researching things. Open your eyes. Go watch:\n\"Out of Shadows\" \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=0wTiCxXgrJw\n\nYou now have all the time in the world. Please.... turn off the stupid TV & stop watching the news. Start researching from sources that have NO financial gain or conflict of interest. Then you will learn quite a bit. Then you will realize you've been lied to & manipulated your whole friggin' life.\n\nTake the blinders off \ud83d\udc40\nTIME TO WAKE UP from the deep sleep you are in!", "comments": "90", "shares":
