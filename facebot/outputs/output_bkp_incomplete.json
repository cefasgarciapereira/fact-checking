        "content": "HOORAY FOR BUBBA WATSON! He put into words what I think most of us are feeling. Thank you sir!\nThis is from Bubba Watson... pro golfer and a stand up guy.\nExactly the way I feel today.\n*****\nI\u2019m so confused right now. I see signs all over saying black lives matter. I\u2019m just trying to figure out which black lives matter. It can\u2019t be the unborn black babies. They are destroyed without a second thought. It\u2019s not black cops. They don\u2019t seem to matter. It\u2019s not my black conservative friends. They are told to shut up if they know what\u2019s best for them by their black counterparts. It\u2019s not black business owners. Their property does not mean anything. It\u2019s not blacks who fought in the military. Their statues are destroyed by the black lives matter protesters with disdain. So which black lives matter again?\nBlack Lives Matter. Of course they do! Then when multiple black police officers and individuals were killed during the \u201cpeaceful protests\u201d. I don\u2019t see any outrage? Black individually owned businesses burned to the ground. Silence. Deadliest weekend in Chicago. NOTHING!!\nI can\u2019t keep up. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019m exhausted trying to figure out what we\u2019re all supposed to do  believe  and be offended and outraged by next.\nTwo months ago  First Responders were all the rage. In fact  they were heroes. We gave them free coffee  meals  and cheers as they drove by. Today  we hate them and want them defunded because they can\u2019t be trusted.\nTwo months ago  truck drivers were the heroes  as well  for keeping America moving and the grocery stores stocked. Today we block the roads with protesters  drag them out of the cabs and beat them half to death.\nNurses and Doctors are still cool for now. But they may be unemployed. They too are heroes  unless of course they truly believe all lives matter. Then they\u2019re filled with hate and are part of problem like so many others.\nJust 45 days ago protests weren\u2019t \u201cessential\u201d and were considered criminal  selfish and a murderous activity. Today they are gloriously critical and celebrated. All of the obvious criminal and murderous activities are simply ignored. If you protest about lock downs for freedom  you are selfish and you will spread a virus. If you protest  loot  and riot for social justice  you are a warrior and the virus fades to the background.\nTrust the experts. No  not those experts. Don\u2019t wear masks ... wear masks  but only good ones. Wait  don\u2019t wear masks  wear anything as a mask. Never mind on the masks. Not sure  but if you don\u2019t  you hate people because you could be an asymptomatic spreader. Wait. That's not a thing anymore?\nFor 3 months  NOTHING was more important than social distance. In fact  we gave up all of our liberties for it. We canceled schools  medical and dental procedures  yet allowed the murder of babies  canceled activities  closed businesses  eliminated every spring rite of passage from prom to graduation  denied people funerals  even at Arlington  and we wrecked the economy for it. Then came social justice  and social distance was no more. Now things are more cut and dried though. A thousand people at three memorials for someone they never even met. It's a matter of \"respect\". But you can only assemble 100 or less people.\nI\u2019m really confused now. Look at the data  NO  not that data. Do the math. No  you can\u2019t do the math like that. Only the experts can understand the data and math. What do you mean other cities/states/governors are interpreting the data differently? Pools are safe in Indiana  but not Michigan? Playgrounds are safe in your town but not mine? Amusement parks are safe in Florida but not Ohio  nor Michigan.\nIf you are silent you are part of the problem. If you speak  you are part of the problem. If you have to ask  you don\u2019t understand. If you don\u2019t ask  you don\u2019t care.\nIt\u2019s all so predictable  tedious  and exhausting. Nothing adds up. It\u2019s one gigantic Math life problem  with ever changing denominators that I\u2019m sure the media and politicians are eagerly ready to solve for us...until the next \"crisis\".\nSo  for now I pray. I pray God will heal our land and bless the United States of America! Bless us with Wisdom  Kindness  Gentleness  Mercy  Love  Peace and Healing. Things that Really Matter! We all Matter in God's Eyes!",

Lewis(1942)\n\n\u201cAnd how did you manage to bring so many souls to hell at that time? -Because of fear. -Ah  yes. Excellent strategy; old and always current. But what were they afraid of? Fear of being tortured? Fear of war? Fear of hunger? -No. -Fear of getting sick. -But then  no one else got sick at that time? -No. -Yes  they were sick. -I'm sorry. -Nobody else was dying? -Yes  they died. -But there was no cure for the disease? -There was. -Then I don't understand. - Since no one else believed and taught about eternal life and eternal death  they thought they had only that life  and they clung to it with all their strength  even if it cost them their affection (they did not hug or greet each other  they had no human contact for days and days); their money (they lost their jobs  spent all their savings  and still thought themselves lucky to be prevented from earning their bread); their intelligence (one day the press said one thing and the next day it contradicted itself  and still they believed it all); their freedom (they did not leave their house  did not walk  did not visit their relatives. ...it was a big concentration camp for voluntary prisoners! They accepted everything  everything  as long as they could overcome their miserable lives one more day. They no longer had the slightest idea that He  and only He  is the one who gives life and ends it. It was like that  as easy as it had ever been.\u201d\nFrom the book \"Letters of the Devil to His Nephew\" by C.S. Lewis  the Christian author of \u201cThe Chronicles of Narnia\u201d...The book published in 1942.",

        "content": "       Since yesterday in the Austrian Parliament a politician presented one of our rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 and referred to it as \u2032\u2032 worthless \u2032\u2032 after using with Coke and a \u2032\u2032 positive \u2032\u2032 result  we are forced to take a stand on this topic. There are things to consider here that have been misused: For one thing  the \u2032\u2032 sample \u2032\u2032 was not swivelled out in a buffer. In a properly executed test  the sample is always swirled first in a liquid (buffer) that keeps the pH constant. Applying the \u2032\u2032 sample \u2032\u2032 (in this case coke that has a pH of 2 5) as in the case of the politician without using the buffer  you destroy the antibody protein of the test that comes with the Virus is reacting. This destroys the buffer layer and makes the positive marker visible. This result would also be expected if any other manufacturer had such an application. If the test had been properly applied  as described in the accompanying text  the test would be negative. In order to provide proof here  we have correctly executed the test with a coke. The result was negative as you can see in the video. Such tests should always be carried out by hospital staff or by being carried out by trained individuals to avoid such results and representations.",

A doctor friend suggested she be tested for legionnaires disease because she wore the same mask every day all day long. Turns out it WAS legionnaires disease from the moisture and bacteria in her mask. She was given antibiotics and within two days was better. WHAT IF these \"spikes\" in COVID are really something else due to mask wearing??\nCopied and pasted - and checked - it's true!",

While I know the HEADLINES over the last couple days have stated something entirely different  that is because journalism is dead. Again  THERE IS NO LAW THAT STATES YOU MUST WEAR A MASK. Ask our local Police chief or officers. They will not  and cannot  cite ANYBODY for not wearing a mask because the law does not exist. When you come across Newsom's \"orders\" online  you will see it's linked to a page that does not lead you to his Executive Order  BUT to the California Department of Public Health GUIDELINES! Again  NOBODY can be forced to wear a mask outside  in a business  or as an employee or customer. Spread the Word.....

        "content": "Rilievi anatomopatologici sui deceduti per Covid 19. Vi riporto Il mess.mandato nella' nostra chat di medici da colleghi di Brescia.....il nostro servizio di Anatomia Patologica ha iniziato ad eseguire autopsie sui pazienti COVID19-positivi  dopo qualche remora iniziale poich\u00e9 la loro societ\u00e0 scientifica internazionale ha classificato COVID-19 tra i patogeni appartenenti all\u2019hazard group 3 (al pari di antrace  prioni  alcuni micobatteri\u2026 per intenderci  Ebola appartiene all\u2019HG 4  che \u00e8 il livello massimo di pericolosit\u00e0). Ad oggi hanno totalizzato circa 50 autopsie  nella quasi totalit\u00e0 dei casi mirate ai polmoni. Stanno aspettando uno scafandro speciale per poter eseguire  in sicurezza  anche l\u2019esame autoptico sul cervello.\nLa nostra \u00e8 la pi\u00f9 ampia casistica mondiale  poich\u00e9 i cinesi hanno pubblicato solo i risultati di 3 autopsie \u201cminimally invasive\u201d (+ un altro isolato case report) e poich\u00e9 l\u2019unico altro ospedale italiano che esegue autopsie \u00e8 il Sacco (con riferiti circa 20 casi).\nVi riporto quello che ho carpito della dissertazione anatomo-patologica (presentata da Gianatti e Sonzogni) e gli interventi pi\u00f9 significativi di alcuni dei presenti.\nGi\u00e0 macroscopicamente i polmoni appaiono \u201cspotty\u201d  con aree iperemico/emorragiche alternate ad aree rosee. Istologicamente  alcune aree sono gravemente enfisematose  con vasi sanguigni enormemente dilatati (fino a 20 volte la norma) spesso repleti di microtrombi. In molti casi \u00e8 evidente un danno alveolare diffuso (DAD)  con desquamazione dei pneumociti  formazione di membrane ialine e di un essudato fibrotico (come nell\u2019ARDS). Appare come una sindrome ad alta portata  con epatomegalia e vasi portali dilatati con trombosi diffuse a tutti i livelli. Anche il cuore appare ingrandito  presenta sempre un idropericardio ed una marcata ipertrofia ventricolare sx (ma sono quasi sempre pazienti ipertesi in anamnesi). In un caso hanno osservato un trombo quasi completamente ostruente la vena cava superiore e l\u2019atrio dx. Hanno notato spesso la risalita del diaframma  indice del fatto che ad un certo punto i polmoni non si espandono pi\u00f9  associata ad epatomegalia. Sessa  nell\u2019attesa di avere dati su campioni da SNC  ha chiesto di poter eseguire biopsie della mucosa olfattoria; COVID-19 d\u00e0 classicamente anosmia ed ageusia: potrebbe arrivare al tronco encefalico per via trans-sinaptica partendo dalle terminazioni nervose periferiche del nervo olfattorio o di quello linguale (oltrech\u00e8 dall\u2019innervazione dei polmoni). In questo scenario  parte dell\u2019insufficienza respiratoria potrebbe essere causata dal danno diretto del virus sui nuclei del tronco dell\u2019encefalo (nucleo ambiguo  del tratto solitario\u2026). Dal punto di vista delle cellule del sistema immunitario  nell\u2019interstizio intervengono molti macrofagi ma pochissimi linfociti. Rambaldi sottolinea che nel sangue dei pazienti con infezione da COVID-19 c\u2019\u00e8 un numero elevatissimo di cellule endoteliali (espressione del danno endoteliale causato direttamente dal virus) e che queste cellule scatenano uno storm citochinico che recluta soprattutto i macrofagi. \u00c8 anche per questo motivo che il cortisone ad alte dosi potrebbe funzionare. \u00c8 stato usato su 6 pazienti un farmaco anti-complemento (narsoplimab  lo studio \u00e8 chiuso) che ha ridotto drasticamente il numero di cellule endoteliali plasmatiche circolanti (ma non sono stati specificati i clinical end-points).\nIn conclusione: gli anatomo-patologi ci dicono di chiedere liberamente le autopsie che riteniamo opportune (soprattutto le morti improvvise  o i decessi nei pazienti relativamente giovani ed altrimenti sani)  corredandole di quante pi\u00f9 informazioni possibili (comorbidit\u00e0  data di esordio dei sintomi  terapie effettuate  sistema di supporto di O2  passaggio in TI). Questo per capire quanto di \u201cpregresso\u201d ci sia nei polmoni disastrati che hanno esaminato e per spiegarsi alcuni reperti anomali (ad esempio un caso di amiloidosi oppure un abnorme ispessimento del miocardio che secondo Senni non pu\u00f2 essere riconducibile ad una miocardite acuta\u2026).io sono Eliana cammarata medico radiologo di la spezia ...la chat \u00e8 con i colleghi della specialit\u00e0 a Udine ..",

        "content": "Autopsies Prove that COVID-19 is a Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Pulmonary Thrombosis) It is now clear that the whole world has been attacking the so-called Coronavirus Pandemic wrongly due to a serious pathophysiological diagnosis error. According to valuable information from Italian pathologists  ventilators and intensive care units were never needed. Autopsies performed by the Italian pathologists has shown that it is not pneumonia but it is Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (Thrombosis) which ought to be fought with antibiotics  antivirals  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. If this is true for all cases  that means the whole world is about to resolve this novel pandemic earlier than expected. However  protocols are currently being changed in Italy who have been adversely affected by this pandemic. The impressive case of a Mexican family in the United States who claimed they were cured with a home remedy was documented: three 500 mg aspirins dissolved in lemon juice boiled with honey  taken hot. The next day they woke up as if nothing had happened to them! Well  the scientific information that follows proves they are right! This information was released by a medical researcher from Italy: \u201cThanks to 50 autopsies performed on patients who died of COVID-19  Italian pathologists have discovered that IT IS NOT PNEUMONIA  strictly speaking  because the virus does not only kill pneumocytes of this type  but uses an inflammatory storm to create an endothelial vascular thrombosis.\u201d In disseminated intravascular coagulation  the lung is the most affected because it is the most inflamed  but there is also a heart attack  stroke and many other thromboembolic diseases. In fact  the protocols left antiviral therapies useless and focused on anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting therapies. These therapies should be done immediately  even at home  in which the treatment of patients responds very well. If the Chinese had denounced it  they would have invested in home therapy  not intensive care! So  the way to fight it is with antibiotics  anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants. An Italian pathologist reports that the hospital in Bergamo did a total of 50 autopsies and one in Milan  20  that is  the Italian series is the highest in the world  the Chinese did only 3  which seems to fully confirm the information. In a nutshell  the disease is determined by a disseminated intravascular coagulation triggered by the virus; therefore  it is not pneumonia but pulmonary thrombosis  a major diagnostic error. Some world leaders doubled the number of resuscitation places in the ICU  with unnecessary exorbitant costs. According to the Italian pathologist  treatment in ICUs is useless if thromboembolism is not resolved first. \u201cIf we ventilate a lung where blood does not circulate  it is useless  in fact  nine (9) patients out of ten (10) will die because the problem is cardiovascular  not respiratory.\u201d \u201cIt is venous microthrombosis  not pneumonia  that determines mortality.\u201d According to the literature  inflammation induces thrombosis through a complex but well-known pathophysiological mechanism. Unfortunately  what the scientific literature said  especially Chinese  until mid-March was that anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used. Now  the therapy being used in Italy is with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics  as in influenza  and the number of hospitalized patients has been reduced. He also discovered that many deaths  even in their 40s  had a history of fever for 10 to 15 days  which were not treated properly. The inflammation does a great deal of tissue damage and creates ground for thrombus formation. However  the main problem is not the virus  but the immune hyperreaction that destroys the cell where the virus is installed. In fact  patients with rheumatoid arthritis have never needed to be admitted to the ICU because they are on corticosteroid therapy  which is a great anti-inflammatory. With this important discovery  it is possible to return to normal life and open closed deals due to the quarantine  though not immediately  but with time. Kindly share so that the health authorities of each country can make their respective analysis of this information  prevent further deaths and redirect investments appropriately; the vaccine may come later. *linkedin source",

        "content": "OK  since this video by Drs. Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook  I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all  I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark  he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. However in order to quarantine the sick and not the well  you need to know who is sick and who is well. That's the problem with Covid-19 is that unlike measles or most other infectious diseases  people can spread the disease when they are asymptomatic so how do you know who needs to be quarantined and who doesn't? Ideally  you do what South Korea did and have lots of testing available and you test everyone and then you trace all their contacts and test them and now you know who has the virus and who doesn't and you quarantine those who have the virus and let the others go about their business. We did not have testing and we still do not have enough testing to test everyone. so what do you do when you don't know who has the virus? yeah  you quarantine everyone. 2. around the 4 minute mark  they say that they had 340 out of 5213 tests positive (6.5%). Then they talk about how 12% of the tests in california were positive and 39% of the tests in new york were positive. Then they say that Ca has 39 million people and 12% of them being positive means 4.5 million people have covid-19. THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS VIDEO. Either they are being purposely misleading or they completely forgot statistics 101. They are confusing testing within a high pretest probability cohort with a random sample of the population that can be extrapolated to the general population. Let me explain. Until now  the way covid testing worked was that there were so few tests that we only tested people that we were pretty sure had the disease. And even if we were pretty sure they had the disease  if they had mild symptoms  we didn't test them. Therefore the tested samples will have a much higher rate of positivity than the general population. This kind of thought process would be like I run an emergency room and tonight 10% of the people have a stroke. Then I extrapolate that to mean that 10% of the world is having a stroke tonight. That's obviously ludicrous. The sample of people coming to the ER is not representative of the entire population. There are currently random testing studies being done to look at prevalence in the general population and I've discussed them and they think the prevalence is about 2-3 percent. These are early studies and still should not be used to extrapolate nationwide and have problems dealing with bayesian probability and testing specificity but are FAR FAR better than using testing data in a hospital setting to the population. That's just plain wrong. He keeps saying he's following the science and using data. The problem is that he doesn't understand data and is misinterpreting it and is NOT following the science. 3. Around 13 minutes  they discuss Norway and Sweden. Sweden has 1 765 deaths. Norway has 182 deaths. He claims this is statistically insignificant. I have no idea what statistical test he used and I'm pretty sure he has no idea either because he didn't do one. The correct test to do would be a chi squared test with Yates correction. That gives a P value of <0.0001. That's about as statistically significant as it gets! In fact  you don't even need to do a statistical test on it. Sweden has 10 times the deaths as Norway. No one looks at a ten fold increase and says \"BAH  that's nothing!\" 4. Around 16 minutes he talks about the downsides of the shutdown. These are valid points there are DEFINITELY downsides. 5. Around 18 he starts talking about the immune system. He talks about how the immune system needs to be exposed to pathogens to develop. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. But then he takes immunological development in a child to adults in quarantine. NOT TRUE. Unless you live inside a bubble  your home and your yard have TRILLIONS of pathogens. No amount of lysol and handwashing is going to remove pathogens that you breathe in and touch all the time. Your own mouth has billions of microbes. Your skin is teeming with microbes. Fungal spores and viruses in the air. Your immune system will 100% not be weaker by being at home. Your immune system might get weaker if you stay home  don't exercise and eat candy all day but the fact of being home in an of it self will not harm your immune system. 6. Around 26 minutes he says academics and reality are two different things. This appeals to some people but in this case  they need to go back to academics to learn basic statistics. 7. Around 27 minutes he talks about all the fomites you bring from costco to your house and totally contradicts his own point from 18 minutes (#5) 8. Around 28 he talks about the logical inconsistency for being able to go to costco but not to work or church. Because you're going to be interacting with people at either place. YES  ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Ideally  people should go nowhere. But we do need to eat and there's no other mechanism available to get food so they are letting what they consider \"essential\" continue. Now what's considered essential is up for debate since they've said liquor stores are essential which I personally disagree with but there is a logic in that. 9. Around 30  he claims doctors are being pressured to add covid to the diagnosis. That is definitely not happening at Loma LInda University or any other institution that I've spoken to. 10. Around the same time he talks about how covid doesn't kill people  their preexisting condition kills them. well we know for a fact that young healthy people have died. not often and definitely having poor health before makes you more likely to succumb. 11. Around 33. they said widespread testing is needed to open the economy. YUP. THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING. 12. Around 34  he says that covid and flu kill people. Completely contradicting himself from 3 minutes ago. 13. Around 37 he talks about quarantining the sick. YES  but no one knows who is infected or not right now and THAT is the biggest problem. 14. Around 41 minutes  they said that no one does in house testing. Actually every major hospital does in house testing. Loma Linda  USC  UCLA  Stanford  U of Washington  etc. 15. Around 45 minutes he talks about staying home if you have symptoms. Yes  but maybe he's not aware that people are infectious and shedding virus when they have no symptoms and a significant proportion NEVER get symptoms but are still spreading the virus. That's what makes covid-19 harder to get a handle on. If people didn't shed virus until AFTER they had symptoms it would be very easy. Just tell everyone to stay home once they get symptoms. problem solved. Unfortunately  this one transmits before symptoms are evident. 16. Around 47 they claim the virus will mutate and become less and less virulent. There is absolutely zero basis for that claim. None WHATSOEVER. It's possible that it will mutate and become less virulent but then that virus will be out-competed by the parental strain that is more virulent. It's also possible that it will mutate and become MORE virulent. There is no basis for which to say that a virus will mutate and become less virulent. 17. Around 48 minutes  they make a claim saying that academics haven't seen a patient in 20 years. That's not how academic medicine works. I see patients every day. And I see the patients that are too complex for the doctors in the community to deal with. 18. Around 50 minutes  they claim that wearing masks and gloves reduces your bacterial flora. You get your bacterial flora from the food you eat  the clothes you wear  the air you breathe. Wearing masks and gloves have minimal impact on that especially since most people take those things off once they get home. They also claim that they spoke to Kern County public health commissioner who agrees with them. That's not true either.",

        "content": "OK  since this video by Drs. Erickson and Massihi has been making the rounds on facebook  I feel like I need to respond. Now first of all  I actually agree with the basic premise that this is not as dangerous as we first thought and we should probably move to open. However they make many false and misleading claims so I feel like I need to respond. This video is I believe making the rounds because it sounds internally logical and has many facts that are either deliberately or inadvertantly misinterpreted and about 95% of the things they are saying are true and then there's the 5% that's the gotcha. So let's go through it point by point. 1. at around the 3 minute mark  he says that we should quarantine the people that are sick and not the people that are well. ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

        "content": "Okay  sooooo....during all of this fake Pandemic BS  I don't wear gloves all because I have enough brains to realize I'd have to change gloves every single time I touch one thing & then I touch another thing -- I know that cross contamination would happen with all the items I touched with the same friggin' gloves.\n\nI'm not wearing a face mask because... it is the perfect breeding ground for bacteria that can end up in your mouth & down into your lungs. I have learned that there are many harmful effects of rebreathing Carbon Dioxide (CO2). And CO2 is a gas the body naturally produces as WASTE. We breathe in oxygen (O2) to fuel organs & tissues & the end product is CO2. The balance between these two gases is required for a healthy body. However  when we rebreathe CO2 it can have harmful & sometimes very dangerous effects on the body. When CO2 levels are elevated in the body it is known as Hypercapnia. Hypercapnia can occur for a number of reasons  one of which is rebreathing our own exhaled CO2. Rebreathing CO2 can lead to increased blood pressure  headaches  muscle twitches  rapid heart rate  chest pain  confusion  & even fatigue. In extreme cases  if left untreated  Hypercapnia can lead to organ damage & sometimes even have long standing effects on the brain. UM. HELLO ~ Upper respiratory infection - anyone!? NO TO MASKS.\n\nI only do social distancing to a certain extent  all because I respect others personal space... but not because I'm afraid of my fellow Americans  friends or my neighbors. In fact  I would gladly hug a stranger right now - in public if it was a mutual feeling. Because hugging releases endorphins which uplifts your mood & it also relieves lots of stress... and well ~ there is a whole lotta' stress going on right now in this crazy @ss world.\n\nI have never  ever gotten the flu shot because I don't believe in injecting aluminum  formaldehyde  mercury  monkey cells & aborted fetus cells (just to name a few) directly into my body  blood  muscles. No way!!! AND - I also do not want to increase my chances of getting an upper respiratory illness including 4 strains of Coronavirus by 36%. NO THANKS!\n\nI will NOT be getting tested for Rona even if I show symptoms  because we have seen so many different stories all over the internet about the tests being contaminated with Coronavirus & now I see a cross contamination with HIV at this point. Plus  I already know they will label it Covid-19 without an actual test & I'll be added to the fake numbers that are increasing this panic all over something I may or may not truly have. I have heard from nurses themselves that say they would just tell me to go home & get some rest ...but seeeeeee  thing is -- I'm smart enough to stay home & away from people when sick or have symptoms of being sick.\n\nAND I know to wash my hands with soap & water because... well  that's just freakin' common sense.\n\nUM  I WILL NOT GET THE VACCINE! The government has never mandated a vaccine ever & I'll be damned if they force me put something in my body  that was created in less than 2 weeks of this \"outbreak\". I'm not a sheep  never will be a sheep & I refuse to be manipulated by the Gov. into thinking they have our best interest at hand. Riiiiiiiggghhht\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI believe in God. I know Jesus is my Savior. I will not live in fear  for I know that God is ultimately in control. So  if you want to stay in your house & never go out because you are \"doing the right thing\" that's fine  that's you  that ain't me though. I'm not going to let the media scare me into thinking this is some kind of mass Pandemic. That's what they want. They wanna shut this country down & here they are ~ doing it right in front of all of our faces. I will continue to go out & support locals as much as possible. I live in my life by \ud83d\ude4f Faith & not by fear.\n\nLook folks -- just start researching things. Open your eyes. Go watch:\n\"Out of Shadows\" \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=0wTiCxXgrJw\n\nYou now have all the time in the world. Please.... turn off the stupid TV & stop watching the news. Start researching from sources that have NO financial gain or conflict of interest. Then you will learn quite a bit. Then you will realize you've been lied to & manipulated your whole friggin' life.\n\nTake the blinders off \ud83d\udc40\nTIME TO WAKE UP from the deep sleep you are in!",

I will do this as safely as possible protecting my staff  myself and my guests with the measures we have put into place.\nI was raised with an understanding that providing sustenance to people is a holy thing and I will try to live up to my upbringing.\nI will not rely on my politicians.\nI will not rely on populist opinion.\nI will not rely on a bunch of stooges in masks with AR-15\u2019s taking our state houses hostage.\nI will not rely on ininformed selfish short sighted people that may need a haircut or a massage.\nI will rely on educated and informed scientists.\nI will rely on our medical professionals working to keep us as safe as possible.\nI will rely on unbiased informed data that will hopefully guide everyone in my industry to do their best.\nOne step at a time we will move forward  but with the information at hand  I believe it is too early to risk the health of my staff  myself  and my guests!",

Is it coincidence that just when the economy is booming  the stock market is setting record highs  we are winning the trade wars  school shootings have stopped and our nation is at peace and it looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment  then all the sudden world crisis pandemic. Stock market tumbles  companies are laying off employees  everything is closed and cancelled ect. Now they say there are a couple ways a President doesn't win reelection. Those are an unpopular war or a poor economy. I can't help but think there is something larger going on here driving this sudden outbreak right after Trump beats an impeachment. Especially the fact that it originated in China who we are in a global trade war with brought on by Trump. I am sure China doesn't want 4 more years of Trump either. I am not a conspiracy theorist but it all seems rather convenient for the nations and opponents of our current President and economy 5 months before an election. Couldn't have hit at a more perfect time. With the Democrats running out of campaign talking points in light of no school shootings  no migrant caravans at the southern border  fighting in Syria winding down  North Korea not firing missiles and Trump beating a sham impeachment. The corona virus gave them one last hail mary to try and point fingers at Trump with the clock winding down on 2020. This is almost the perfect fascist playbook. Control the population with fear mongering and panic  control the media and propaganda  and the fan favorite disarm the population. I guess I am a skeptic. Sorry but I don't think we are all going to die. Remember when Ebola was what was going to kill us all  and the media kept showing the piles of body bags that were prepared for the fallout. Then a month later it was totally forgotten. I wish people could just go about their lives until this plays out. I'll worry when there is a significant death toll like nearing a million or something. A handful of deaths out of 320 million Americans and we are in panic tearing down our society and costing our economy billions in the wake. It all just seems fishy  a little too well timed if you ask me. Call me cynical all you want.
